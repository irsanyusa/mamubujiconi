To cope with problems</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>When people get stressed at work, they often look for a distraction. Some people watch pornography at work as it serves as a distraction, helps them manage stress and deal with a bad mood. If you use porn to destress, it’s a massive red flag that may be linked to problematic pornography being used to cope with other issues.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-6>2. Enjoy having a secret enjoyment while at work</h3></p><p>Some people enjoy feeling as if they are pulling a fast one over their ignorant coworkers. It may even be that an overworked employee wants to get back at the company for treating them badly.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-9>3. To assert control</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>It’s not all fun and games; openly watching porn in the workplace is sexual harassment.
