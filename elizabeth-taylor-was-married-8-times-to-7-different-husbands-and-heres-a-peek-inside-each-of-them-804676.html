She started in&nbsp;Hollywood as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child star, until she transitioned into mature roles in&nbsp;the 1950s by&nbsp;starring in&nbsp;romantic films.</p><p>Taylor became the highest-paid movie star during the 1960s. She is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;multi-award-winning <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actress</a>, with 3&nbsp;Oscars and 4&nbsp;Golden Globes under her belt.</p><p>Taylor was considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the most beautiful woman in&nbsp;the world during her prime, and was reportedly described as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“miracle of&nbsp;construction.”</p><p>Her gorgeous hair, hourglass figure, rare violet eyes, and double-row of&nbsp;eyelashes (due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;genetic <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mutation</a>) made her so&nbsp;exquisite, that some researchers even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>analyzed</a> her features.</p><p><h2>She thought her roles made her yearn to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;adult, which triggered a&nbsp;string of&nbsp;marriages.</h2></p><p>Taylor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> her onscreen image made her want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;real woman and a&nbsp;wife. And she saw marriage as&nbsp;a&nbsp;way for her to&nbsp;live independent adulthood. She also admitted to&nbsp;being an&nbsp;“incurable romantic.”</p><p><h2>She married her first husband at&nbsp;18&nbsp;years old, and it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;quick affair.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9a6/e77/2b529c5a85b72bf4cb20d7b1c2.jpg><p>Her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>first</a> hubby was Conrad ’Nicky’ Hilton&nbsp;Jr., and they were together for only 8&nbsp;months&nbsp;— from May 1950 to&nbsp;January 1951. Hilton was the son of&nbsp;hotelier Conrad Hilton.</p><p>According to&nbsp;reports, the 2&nbsp;broke up&nbsp;because of&nbsp;Hilton’s bad <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>habits</a>.</p><p><h2>She became a&nbsp;mother in&nbsp;her second marriage.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f26/bf5/67d7875c39adb05fd4f6e19fd9.jpg><p>Taylor gave marriage a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>second</a> try in&nbsp;February 1952. She said “Yes” to&nbsp;British <a href=# title=actor data-link=tag>actor</a> Michael Wilding, who was 20&nbsp;years older than her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3cf/df8/42a1f85679ba7faaa21dce32f4.jpg><p>Their union bore 2&nbsp;sons, Michael&nbsp;Jr. and Christopher. In&nbsp;one article, Christopher <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> that when they were kids, Taylor allowed them to&nbsp;play with her Golden Globe trophies, but not with her Oscars.</p><p>When Taylor’s career catapulted, her relationship with Wilding soured. And after 5&nbsp;years of&nbsp;marriage, they went their separate ways.</p><p><h2>The third time’s a&nbsp;“charm,” and fittingly&nbsp;so, because it&nbsp;was filled with lavish gifts and jewelry.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/552/641/97898f52a2b4d2f0d756c0081c.jpg><p>Just a&nbsp;month after she ended her marriage with Wilding, Taylor walked down the aisle again with her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>third</a> husband, entertainment producer Mike Todd. The couple had one child, named Liza.</p><p>Todd apparently indulged his wife with fancy gifts&nbsp;— from having a&nbsp;special meal flown from Paris to&nbsp;setting up&nbsp;an&nbsp;entire jewelry display in&nbsp;their yard.</p><p>Sadly, their relationship came to&nbsp;an&nbsp;abrupt end when Todd was killed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;plane crash in&nbsp;1958.</p><p><h2>Her fourth marriage was controversial, but she remained unapologetic about&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4f7/c18/9a9ffd5a389b9b1b8959868e16.jpg><p>Her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>marriage</a> with singer Eddie Fisher in&nbsp;1959 made headlines for the wrong reasons.</p><p>Fisher was still married to&nbsp;actress Debbie Reynolds back then, but he&nbsp;left her to&nbsp;marry Taylor. And this resulted in&nbsp;negative publicity for both of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Taylor reportedly announced that their honeymoon phase would last for 40&nbsp;years, but 5&nbsp;years after exchanging “I&nbsp;do’s,” the 2&nbsp;already called it&nbsp;quits.</p><p><h2>Her turbulent relationship with her 5th (and 6th) husband hit Hollywood like a&nbsp;storm.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/915/2fb/d2fd03511e820a6503bbb33228.png><p>Taylor fell in&nbsp;love with actor Richard Burton on&nbsp;the movie set of&nbsp;<i>Cleopatra. </i>It&nbsp;became a&nbsp;whirlwind romance, and the 2&nbsp;got <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> within the same month that Taylor got <a href=# title=divorced data-link=tag>divorced</a> from Fisher (May 1964).</p><p>Their relationship was notorious for being extremely passionate, and they were called out by&nbsp;certain <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>institutions</a> for their inappropriate behavior.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/382/1e7/0a8d395579afb23cc706dbce29.jpg><p>After both starring in&nbsp;a&nbsp;TV drama about divorce, Burton and Taylor ended their 10-year marriage in&nbsp;1974. But that didn’t last long, and after 16&nbsp;months (October 1975) they tied the knot again.</p><p>Taylor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> she loved Burton insanely that she would never wed anyone else. But their second marriage lasted even less than a&nbsp;year, and Taylor ended up&nbsp;exchanging more vows with other men.</p><p><h2>Even if&nbsp;her last 2&nbsp;marriages didn’t work, she remained good friends with both ex-husbands.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fe8/c8c/86334d55808a2bfb2bb256f7d1.jpg><p>Taylor’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sixth</a> spouse was politician John Warner.

But unlike Taylor, Fortensky wasn’t used to&nbsp;the spotlight and they ultimately ended things in&nbsp;1996.</p><p>Taylor kept in&nbsp;touch with both Warner and Fortensky for the remainder of&nbsp;her life.</p><p><h2>Moving on&nbsp;from her failed marriages, Elizabeth Taylor lived her remaining years with purpose.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c18/2a8/842808584e875e8ec5423d1e48.jpg><p>Even in&nbsp;her later years, Taylor continued to&nbsp;act on&nbsp;television and on&nbsp;stage. She had her own jewelry and perfume line, and she also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>established</a> a&nbsp;foundation that aimed to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;cure for HIV/AIDS.</p><p>Taylor was also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>honored</a> by&nbsp;Queen Elizabeth II&nbsp;for her charitable acts and was made Dame Commander alongside music star Julie Andrews.</p><p>Taylor passed away in&nbsp;2011 from a&nbsp;heart illness. She previously <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a> that she “was destined to&nbsp;give love, be&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother, a&nbsp;wife, and a&nbsp;friend”&nbsp;— and that’s exactly how she lived her life.</p><p>What are your thoughts about the way Elizabeth Taylor handled her marriages?
