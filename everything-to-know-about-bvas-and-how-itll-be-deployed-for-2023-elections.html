Its usage has also eliminated the use of incident forms during accreditation.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-14>Can it be manipulated?</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>With BVAS, INEC has assured Nigerians that elections cannot be manipulated.</p><p>According to Prof. <strong>Mohammad Kuna</strong>, the Special Adviser to the INEC Chairman, Prof.<strong> Mahmood Yakubu,</strong> the design of the electronic device makes it impossible for anyone to tamper with results uploaded to IReV via BVAS.</p><p>“With the nature of BVAS, the uploaded polling units (PUs) results cannot be manipulated. The machine was not designed to edit the photographic results uploaded and sent to the INEC Result Viewing Portal (IReV); and once sent cannot be recalled,” he submitted.</p><p>Also, former Akwa Ibom State Resident Electoral Commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, <strong>Mike Igini </strong>believes BVAS has returned power to the people because the device would make rigging near impossible for politicians.</p><p>“However, power has been returned to the Nigerian electorate, following the introduction of electronic technology, such as the Biometric Voter Accreditation System, BVAS, making manipulation of election results almost impossible,” he said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-20>What if it fails?</h3></p><p>BVAS has been used for at least three elections. In September 10, 2021, when it was first deployed for the Isoko South Constituency 1 bye-election in Delta State, there were complaints that the machine had difficulties capturing the thumbs and faces of some of aged voters.</p><p>There were also complaints about the functionality of the device when it was deployed for the governorship election in Anambra state in November 2021 as the device failed to capture voters.</p><p>In fact, the Anambra governorship election was extended from 2:30pm to 4pm because BVAS malfunctioned.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-24>Solutions…</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>However, to reduce BVAS failure, IGT experts have proffered that the device requires regular software updates and serviceable broadband access to function optimally.</p><p>The INEC has been advised to conduct a comprehensive audit of BVAS to prevent possible disenfranchisement of voters in the forthcoming elections.</p><p>The electoral commission has also been advised to take immediate measures to enhance the infrastructure behind the technology.</p><p>To improve the credibility and transparency of the 2023 elections, the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria (ATCON) has announced its readiness to support the INEC with telecommunication infrastructure.</p><p>The Chairman of the association, <strong>Ajibola Olude</strong> has assured Nigerians that nationwide e-transmission of election results via BVAS to IReV is possible because the telcos network has matured to the level that it can be used for result transmission.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXymwsSrsK2gmaO0bsDOZqKnp6dirqO71K1km66RqHqiusNmn6ivXZ7BrbiMm5xmnJWlubDFxJ1kn6eiYn9xfpJmnKWdk6m2sLrSaKGdmmejuLs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1475819-beyond-colour-black-suit-colours-man-have.html><span>←</span><span>Beyond Colour Black: 4 Other Suit Colours Every Man Needs to Have &amp;amp; How to Rock Them Perfectly</span></a>
