The newspaper writes the actual recordings of his albums were farmed out to <a href=# id=a8d976bc-b649-3e9d-a524-2caeb9beed9d>songwriter Vince Johnson and singer Danny Clinton</a> , each of whom are credited for Archival Footage in the docuseries.</p><p>The newspaper continues: The two apparently had no idea Exotic was going to straight-up pretend he sang them on record, and Exotics inability to perform them in person was something of a running joke during the filming of Tiger King.</p><p>So the Tiger King may be a bigger fraud that we all previously knew and thats saying something. But these music videos still stand as prime time entertainment.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><strong>Here Kitty Kitty</strong></p><p>Perhaps the song most Tiger King fans will be curious about is Here Kitty Kitty. The 2015 song is about Carole Baskin, owner of Big Cat Rescue in Florida and the woman Exotic hired someone to murder. The song chronicles how Exotic believes Baskin murdered her husband, Don Lewis, and disposed of his body. The video even features a look-alike Baskin feeding raw meat to tigers.</p><p>In the YouTube description of the music video, Exotic writes, There is one way to get a message across and that is with music. Everyone loves music.</p><p>I Saw A Tiger</p><p>Heavily featured in the Netflix series is Exotics song I Saw A Tiger, which was released in 2013. The video features Exotics long time partner Joe Finlay as a hunter and many of his tigers. It also features copious amounts of sequins and a snakeskin cowboy hat.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Because You Love Me</p><p>The music video for Exotics song Because You Love Me, which shows Exotic parading around his park and awkwardly interacting with his fans. The video also has many incredible shots of Exotic's eyebrow ring thats seemingly hanging on by a thread.</p><p>Pretty Woman Lover"</p><p>As an openly gay man, Exotic also has a song called Pretty Woman Lover, which is just as odd as it sounds. In the song, Exotic says hes a pretty woman lover and an ugly womans dream, so hes definitely the feminist hero we all need.</p><p><strong>I Cant Believe This Feeling</strong></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In this song, Exotic discovered autotune and used it liberally. Unlike Pretty Woman Lover, this song celebrates Exotics sexuality, featuring a male love interest sitting in a pickup truck and staring awkwardly into the distance as Exotic sings lovingly to him.</p><p>Do You Ever Wonder What Love Could Do?</p><p>This song seems to be an appeal to support wild animal captivity, which seems to go along with Exotics essence. It also features Exotic singing into the tiniest microphone ever and a lot of straining neck veins.</p><p>Bring It On (Please Unite)</p><p>According to the YouTube description, this song was created by Exotic to infect everyone with love and the right to have our animals. This music video has everything: tigers, guns, IV infusions, coffee, right wing media, left wing media, and adoring fans. Oh, and that eyebrow ring still hanging on for dear life.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>How Was I To Know</p><p>This song is a tribute to Exotics late husband Travis Maldonado, who died of an accidental self-inflicted gun shot wound. Yet the loving tribute features a clip from the Netflix series where Maldonado was so angry at Exotic, he punched a big rig. It's an interesting choice.</p><p>A tribute to his beloved brother, this song chronicles Exotics life after G.W.s death. It also has a trippy lens flare filters worth a gander.</p><p>My First Love</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Yet another intense power ballad with a video in the snow (side note: How are all these videos in the snow in Oklahoma?!) Exotic singing by candlelight is truly inspired.</p><p>This Is My Life</p><p>This video has some inexplicable shots of Exotic smelling his partner John Finlays butt, which is about the only notable thing aside from Exotics pink paisley shirt.</p><p>How Was I To Know</p><p>Set to a truly bumping beat, this video features Exotic in a casket in the middle of a field. Hes also oddly edited into a fake drive-in movie screen for a large portion of the video. But, seriously, where did they get this casket?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLqmutJmn56ZnKm1cK3NZpyxoJGqwLW11Z5kmqaUYrK5tMCuqq2hnpx6rbvOpGSarF2ptqix0WaioqaXYsC1rdFmoaidXZrFsMDInKpmpaWotqR51aKbnqejZLWow8%2BmsbM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./15-celebrities-who-look-gorgeous-with-their-natural-hair-795287.html><span>←</span><span>15 Celebrities Who Look Gorgeous With Their Natural Hair</span></a>
