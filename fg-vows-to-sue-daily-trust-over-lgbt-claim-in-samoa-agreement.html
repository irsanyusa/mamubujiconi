It is in line with the philosophy of the President as an avowed democrat who spent a lifetime fighting for the entrenchment of democracy and human rights.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-8563a504-e3a2-4251-b2f7-2cb650155ccf data-caption="Mohammed Idris, Information and National Orientation Minister.

It is however disheartening that some elements are abusing this free environment guaranteed by the Government. We are alarmed by the level of reckless reporting and statements by some media organisations and individuals that border on national security and stability.</p><p>“While we sometimes view and treat those occasional reporting as part of media’s normal work, we have now seen a pattern that is difficult to be wished away as normal journalism.</p><p>“We however did not envisage that Daily Trust and people behind it could descend to the reckless level of attempting to set the country on fire by falsely accusing the government of signing a deal to promote LGBTQ. We found that despicable and wicked because the allegation is nowhere in the document signed. Surprisingly, the paper put forward no evidence nor provided the agreement allegedly signed to prove their point.</p><p>“On the part of the Government, we continue on the honourable path of civility by restraining ourselves from taking self-help or draconian measures. While past governments clamped down on the media for infractions much lower than this, we are however toeing the path of civility and the rule of law.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“The Federal Government is lodging a formal complaint to the NPAN Ombudsman on this irresponsible reporting. In addition, the Federal Government will use every lawful means to seek redress in the court of law.</p><p>“The Federal Government once again restates its friendly policy towards ethical media and free speech. We would however not take fake news and disinformation that would injure the peace of our country and its national security lightly,” he said.</p><p>Named after the Pacific Island Samoa, where it was signed, the agreement covered about 2 billion people from 48 African, 16 Caribbean and 15 Pacific countries that signed it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXyns4yvprCrXam8br%2FUnmSdmZmhxm7A0a6qrWWfq7Kzecugma1lk6GuqrmMoqVmq5GivKJ5wKCpnp2dmru1e8mrpG9qo6U%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./deux-premiers-avenants-signes-pour-action-coeur-de-ville-phase-2.html><span>←</span><span>Deux premiers avenants signs pour Action cur de ville phase 2</span></a>
