They are hungry. A hungry man can go to any length to show his anger.</p><p>“We do not need anybody to tell us that there is hunger in the country. The protest was genuine and the government should listen to them.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“The duty of the government is the welfare of the people. The problem we have now is that people cannot move freely.</p><p>“They have abandoned the farms. People are being killed in their farms and everybody wants to stay where they are safe. It is because the government has failed in this regard that we have hunger.</p><p>“It is wrong for the government to be sharing garri, beans and rice as palliatives. They are turning the people into beggars. The government that is giving the people rice and beans is leading us to poverty.</p><p>“The government is discouraging people from working, whereas, the government must provide an enabling environment for people to work and feed themselves,” he said.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-527a9e3b-4c2b-403f-81ec-2b3eba2df165 data-caption="Prof Afe Babalola, founder of Afe Babalola University, Ado Ekiti"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/zYFktkqTURBXy9jNDY1ZGM1ZDE2YzgxNDdiYmY5MWQ1MGUyNGVkZmI0ZC5qcGVnkZUCzQMWzQG9wsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-15>Babalola supports the call for a new constitution</h3></p><p>The veteran lawyer aligned himself with the <strong>Emeka Anyaoku</strong>-led Patriots group which is pushing for the <a href=# id=01755659-4ea5-465c-b1dc-61bb0ff17b0d data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>scrapping of the 1999 Constitution </a>for a new people constitution through a national conference.</p><p>He, however, said there was no need for a constitutional conference, as the National Assembly could simply reenact and bring back the 1963 constitution.</p><p>“I read the publication of the Patriots visiting President Tinubu and I am in full agreement with them. We need a new Constitution. But I do not agree that we should go through any constitutional conference.</p><p>“Recently, you are aware that President Bola Tinubu asked us to go back to the old National Anthem; there was no conference for it before it was passed by the National Assembly and assented by the President.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“The 1963 Constitution was the one made by all of us. By the same token, the parliament should bring back the 1963 (constitution) and reenact it,” Babalola added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXy1tc2uma6rXaWurbjImquirpWoerXB0aegp59do7aosdGimKerXZ67tbuMm5ygn5GnwG6txZ5km5mSlrmwuMBon7Omo6y%2FrQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./st-vincent-concert-review-all-born-screaming-tour-1236110315.html><span>←</span><span>St. Vincents All Born Screaming Tour Further Certifies Her as Rocks Dark (but Oddl</span></a>
