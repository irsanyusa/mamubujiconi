While talking about the audition process, DeNapoli revealed that she had attempted to make it on the show seven times before season 21. Her resilience in the face of rejection, she says, helped shape her into the musician she is today.</p><p>DeNapoli recounted her first audition at just 16 years old, when she showed up to an open call wearing a picnic dress and singing Chantel’s “Impossible.” Her audition was cut short after just one line, but her mother encouraged her to keep trying. Six months later, DeNapoli submitted a video of herself singing Beyonce’s “Listen,” earning her a skip-the-line pass for the next open call. Although she made it to the callback stage, she ultimately didn’t receive a call to move forward in the competition.</p><p>DeNapoli continued to pursue her passion for music, even auditioning for college musical theater programs. Eventually, she received an email inviting her to another open call for The Voice, where she finally made it to the callback stage once again. This time, she connected with a music industry professional named Luke, who helped her prepare for her audition with Janis Joplin’s “Piece of My Heart,” and “House of the Rising Sun.”</p><p>Despite her nerves, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DeNapoli</a> impressed the judges and earned a coveted spot on the show. Looking back, she says that the experience taught her to trust her intuition and never give up on her dreams.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bella DeNapoli’s Future in The Music Industry</h2><p>DeNapoli is presently actively working on producing new music scheduled for release in the upcoming months. Her fans are eagerly anticipating this new material, and DeNapoli is working hard to ensure that it meets their high expectations. DeNapoli’s music is a blend of soul, R&B, and pop, and she is constantly experimenting with new sounds and styles to keep her music fresh and exciting.</p><p>In addition to new music releases, the singer has a busy schedule of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming performances</a>. She is set to perform at several music festivals and concerts in the coming months, and she is also planning her own headline tour.</p><p>DeNapoli’s plans for the future go beyond just releasing new music and performing live. She is also passionate about using her platform to give back to her community and make a positive impact on the world. DeNapoli actively participates in various charitable organizations and remains dedicated to utilizing her success to create a positive impact in the lives of others.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-></h2><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Original_ChanceTheRapper_Evans-Vestal-Ward_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="Chance the Rapper Says ‘The Voice’ Red Chair Has Temperature Control Settings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmecClrKZlkpq5ra2MnZynmaCkuap5y6impKtdl66kt4yaq2afoqqyrbXNoGSjp6Wnu6bFjKilZqyYmnq0tM6wZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-killers-bruce-springsteen-madison-square-garden-concert-review-6092.html><span>←</span><span>The Killers Bring Out Bruce Springsteen at Triumphant Madison Square Garden Show: Concert Review</span></a>
