He also thanked the owners of the house for letting them record there.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ed-sheeran-performs-in-npr-tiny-desk-concert>Ed Sheeran Performs in NPR Tiny Desk Concert</h2><p>Sheeran opened the video with a performance of his new song “Shivers,” which will have you dancing. He then moved into “Make It Rain,” which he famously covered for the Sons of Anarchy soundtrack in 2014. The bluesy song really shows off his vocal talent.</p><p>The singer also debuted the bouncy new song “Overpass Graffiti,” which is also featured on the upcoming album. “I will always love you, for what it’s worth / We’ll never fade like graffiti on the overpass,” Sheeran sings in the track’s chorus.</p><p>After that, Sheeran moved on to “Visiting Hours,” which is dedicated to his friend Michael Gudinski, who passed away in March. Gudinski was an Australian record executive. Sheeran performed this emotional song at his memorial service.</p><p>Sheeran closed the concert with a performance of the song “Bad Habits.” One <a href=#>YouTube commenter</a> shared that they thought this version of the song was “100 times better than the record version.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>ED SHEERAN TESTS POSITIVE FOR COVID-19, WHAT THIS MEANS FOR ‘THE VOICE’ MEGA MENTOR</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-does-sheeran-s-new-album-come-out>When Does Sheeran’s New Album Come Out?</h3><p>Ed Sheeran’s newest album = (which he pronounces as “equals”) will be released this Friday, October 29.

The singer is scheduled to appear as a musical guest on Saturday Night Live on November 6.</p><p>It’s not clear if Sheeran will keep that appearance next week, and if it will be in person or remote. Neither the singer nor SNL <a href=#>has made an announcement</a> about it yet, so we’ll just have to wait and see.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1348364735-1.jpg alt="Melanie C Dishes About On-Stage Cameo with Coldplay at Hollywood Bowl" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>ed sheeran</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmecyenpplnZq7tbvRZpydZaOdsqa%2BwKdkqZ2im7yzudJmq6KmqWKxpr%2FKZpqoppOav7V5xaumpmWYpLqmew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-are-men-like-this-tom-holland-is-under-fire-for-pic-of-zendaya-he-shared-on-her-b-day-815177.html><span>←</span><span>Why Are Men Like This?
