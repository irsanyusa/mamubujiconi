If you’re looking for a bare-bones bed frame that simply elevates and supports the mattress, but excludes other bells and whistles, you can find some great options for under $100. However, if you’re looking for anything extra in your bed frame, like attached nightstands or an eye-catching headboard, expect to spend between $175 and $300. You’ll find a wide range of options in that price point.</p><h3>Material</h3><p>The materials your bed frame is made from will impact how it looks and feels in the room. The most common materials are wood, metal, and fabric upholstery. Wooden bed frames are a classic for a reason: They’re sturdy and long-lasting, though they tend to be more expensive than metal bed frames. An upholstered bed frame adds a tactile element to your decor, and can be found in a wide range of color options.</p><h3>Style</h3><p>When choosing the best bed frame, consider how that frame might fit into your existing decor, or even enhance it. Are you looking for a minimalist bed frame that doesn’t draw attention to itself, or something colorful or unique to add as a statement piece to the room? Once you narrow down what you want from the design, your options will open up.</p><h2 id=best-places-to-buy-cheap-bed-frames>Best places to buy cheap bed frames</h2><p>One of the best places to look for cheap bed frames is on Amazon. You can sort by price or by other factors, and can find an enormous selection of bed frames at every price point and style. Wayfair is another solid retailer for cheap bed frames, and you can even find bed frames at retailers that are not as well known for bedding products, such as Home Depot.</p><p>If you found this guide useful, you may also appreciate our guides to the <a rel=alternate href=#>best mattresses</a>, the <a rel=alternate href=#>best sleeper sofas</a>, and <a rel=alternate href=#>the best adjustable bed</a> frames.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Where can I find a nice affordable bed frame that isn't Ikea?</h3><p>Amazon is a great place to look for cheap bed frames, because they aggregate results from many different retailers, offering you a wide variety of styles and price points. Wayfair, MattressFirm, and Home Depot also all offer great bed frame options at a low price point.</p><h3>How much is reasonable to spend on a bed frame?</h3><p>Depending on what features you’re most interested in, expect to spend around $100 for a cheap bed frame, and closer to $300 for a more substantial or higher quality, but still inexpensive bed frame.</p><h3>Is it cheaper to build or buy a bed frame?</h3><p>Before trying to build your own bed frame, you might factor in the cost of materials and the value of your time. If you have the skills, time, and materials to build your own bed frame, then it may be cheaper to do it yourself. Otherwise, buying your bed frame will be the cheapest and easiest option.</p><h3>Does a good bed frame make a difference?</h3><p>A good bed frame can not only spruce up the look of your bedroom, it also helps maintain longevity in your mattress by providing support to prevent sagging. Invest in a cheap bed frame now, and expect to reap the rewards over time, in the form of a long-lasting and more comfortable mattress!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lk52yoryMm5ydZZanrq6x0mg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./5-most-dangerous-beaches-in-the-world.html><span>←</span><span>5 most dangerous beaches in the world</span></a>
