The Dance Moms alum recently announced that she’s decided to move out and live alone in a new state.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jojo-siwa-is-moving-into-her-new-apartment>JoJo Siwa is Moving Into Her New Apartment</h2><p>On Instagram, <a href=#>S</a><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">i</a><a href=#>wa</a> announced that she’s finally made the decision to leave their house and live alone. The Dancing With The Stars alum shared a series of airport photos to show the beginning of her moving out adventure.</p><p>In the first photo of the carousel, Siwa can be seen posing for a mirror selfie as she’s sitting on her luggage. Another photo showed her with seven luggage bags taken in 0.5x. Siwa also took the time to make a dance cover while at the airport.</p><p>“I’ve learned a lot in the last week about leases, renters insurance, utilities, flights, cars, locations, furniture, shipping, packing, filming, so much,” she wrote. “Also, moving to a whole different state. I’ll be documenting the WHOLE move on my <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Snapchat</a> in the next few days so go add me to follow along with my solo chaos that’s gonna be happening.”</p><p>According to Siwa, she plans on giving updates real-time so her fans “can really see the chaos happening.” She then stated that she’ll be delivering a “massive life update” before the “big move.”</p><p>“Anyways, I’ll be in Florida for a day with family tomorrow then the next day I’ll be off in a new state ready for this new journey! I think I have all my ducks in a row, but I’m SURE at least one of them is a chicken so stay tuned,” she wrote.</p><p>In late 2019, Siwa announced that her family has set their feet in a new home. According to CNBC, her mansion in Tarzana, California boasts 6,111 square feet. Such includes six bedrooms, five full bathrooms, two living spaces, and a formal dining room.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-recently-celebrated-third-year-gayiversary>She Recently Celebrated Third Year “Gayiversary”</h2><p>Ahead of her moving out announcement, Siwa marked three years of her being <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly queer</a>. The DWTS alum shared a series of photos, including a photo where she was wearing a black t-shirt that says “BEST. GAY. COUSIN. EVER.”</p><p>“3 years ago I made the best decision of my life. People always ask me ‘was coming out scary for you?’ My answer is Absolutely… not only because of the typical fears of judgment when coming out but also coming out while being a ‘child star’ is something that no one had done. This was now a massive part of me that I didn’t wanna hide,” she wrote.</p><p>Siwa went on to share that “big, fancy, important” people told her “not to come out.” Hence, when she did, she “shattered some things.” Despite so, Siwa doesn’t regret coming out.</p><p>“I never cared how it affected anything negatively because I knew anything I lost because I was now out, proud and happy wasn’t something I wanted to be a part of and wasn’t meant for me,” she said. “I’m so grateful to the people who have supported me no matter what, and wanna send love to EVERYONE in the world today. And everyday. Feels like yesterday but at the same time feels like 20 years ago. Happy 3 year gayiversary.”</p><p>Siwa revealed that she’s a part of the LGBTQIA+ community in 2021 through a TikTok video. In the clip, she danced to Lady Gaga’s 2011 hit “Born This Way.” This was a subtle implication of her gender identity, as the song was regarded as a queer anthem.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_BrandonLeake_Mike-CoppolaGetty-Images-for-Bob-Woodruff-Foundation-220x147.jpg alt="Brandon Leake Gives an Update About Health Struggles in Emotional YouTube Video" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>JoJo Siwa</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yaihqGWjnsSiecisZKanpp67qHnIp6uoZZiav26yyKuqrWWVq7KzecCpmKusnZq7tXnRnpidsV2bvLN506GgrGWemsRuts6uqaedqWQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./une-rentree-2300-euros-pour-les-etudiants.html><span>←</span><span>Une rentre 2.300 euros pour les tudiants</span></a>
