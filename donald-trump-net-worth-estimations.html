The interest in that question—debated in court, on the campaign trail, and by the media over the years—has resurfaced following the newly-approved merger between Digital World Acquisition Corp. and Trump Media & Technology Group.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In February, a judge <a href=#>finalized a verdict</a> and ordered Trump to pay a $454 million judgment in a civil fraud lawsuit filed by<a href=#> New York Attorney General Letitia James</a>, ruling that Trump had deceived banks and insurers by inflating the value of his assets. The judge also barred Trump from serving as officer or director of any New York corporation for three years. Trump has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyers are <a href=#>appealing</a>. The hefty sum incited renewed interest over the 2024 presidential candidate’s net worth.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Friday, March 22, Trump said he has <a href=#>nearly $500 million</a> in cash via a post shared on his social media platform, Truth Social. “The often overturned political hack judge on the rigged and corrupt A.G. case, where I have done nothing wrong, knew this, [and] wanted to take it away from me,” Trump claimed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Reports on how much Trump is worth vary. While <a href=#>Forbes’ current estimation of</a> Trump’s real-time net worth is $2.6 billion, and Bloomberg <a href=#>pegs it at</a> $3.1 billion, that amount could increase by billions given the new merger between Digital World Acquisition Corp. and Trump Media & Technology Group that was approved on March 22.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The merger stands to increase Trump’s earnings. According to the <a href=#>Associated Press</a>, Trump is set to own nearly 79 million shares of the combined company, and the total value of his stake could surpass $3 billion. The business deal allows Truth Social, the social media platform launched by the former U.S. President and owned by the Trump Media & Technology Group, to begin trading on the Nasdaq stock market.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At present, the main sources of Trump’s wealth reportedly stem from New York City real estate holdings, golf clubs and resorts, in addition to around $600 million in cash and personal assets, per estimations made by Forbes in Sept. 2023.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Forbes estimated that Trump’s net worth peaked in 2015, the year before he was elected president, at $4.5 billion, then<a href=#> dropped or remained the same annually</a> during and after his presidency, except for a jump to $3.2 billion in 2022. Bloomberg<a href=#> tracked a similar</a> peak before the 2016 election, but also reported a smaller jump in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In 2021, the two publications estimated around the same net worth—roughly $2.4 billion.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Last year, Trump<a href=#> dropped off the Forbes 400 list,</a> the tally of the wealthiest people in the U.S., because of drops in valuation from his <a href=#>Truth Social platform</a> and real estate holdings.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Meanwhile, in January, a jury<a href=#> ordered Trump to pay</a> an additional $83.3 million to journalist E. Jean Carroll, who said he damaged her reputation by saying she lied when accusing him of sexual assault.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Another jury<a href=#> awarded</a> Carroll $5 million in 2023 after finding Trump liable for sexually abusing and defaming her by claiming she invented the story. Trump is <a href=#>appealing</a> the verdict.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvbWhugHeFjp2mp5mcmXq1vtSmp2amlal6uLvRrZ9mnaOptq6t06Kmp6tf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./difficultes-de-recrutement-un-phenomene-conjoncturel-renforce-par-des-tendances-lourdes.html><span>←</span><span>un phnomne conjoncturel renforc par des tendances lourdes ?</span></a>
