It is easy to start over, change your mindset and make the most of it. These quotes will help you pick up the pieces and move on with your life:</p><ul><li>Often, the best way to start over is with a clean slate. To make that happen, it's essential to focus on the good things in your life, not the bad.</li><li>Don't dwell on what went wrong in your past relationships, but think about how great you are and everything you have going for you.</li><li>A heartbreak is a blessing from God. It's just His way of letting you realize that He saved you from the wrong one.</li><li>It may seem impossible to find someone else after you've been hurt so badly, but once you find them, they'll be worth every tear.</li><li>Sometimes, we need something drastic like ending a relationship or changing careers to shake us out of our funk and inspire us to do better.</li><li>Moving on doesn't mean forgetting everything that has happened; instead, try looking at everything as an opportunity to grow mentally and physically stronger.</li><li>Remember that there are always two ways to look at any situation. If you're struggling, remind yourself of the silver lining and put your energy into being positive rather than dwelling on the negative.</li><li>When you're ready to take another chance in love, remember that meeting someone new can open up new doors for you because it forces you to look outside your comfort zone and branch out socially.</li><li>Turning over a new leaf doesn't have to be as dramatic as starting anew; sometimes, it's just re-prioritizing your values and making different choices.</li><li>As hard as it might seem, if you want to get over someone truly, you need to cut off contact entirely until the feeling passes.</li><li>Sometimes, the key to moving on is doing something completely different - even if that means taking risks or venturing into unfamiliar territory.</li><li>No point in staying somewhere you feel unhappy and unfulfilled. Sure, it's easier said than done to pack up and leave when you don't know where you're going, but ultimately, that sense of adventure will lead to personal growth, which is never wrong.</li><li>The only person who can decide whether or not to let go is you!</li><li>Who cares if your ex thinks you made the wrong decision? Your happiness should come before anything else.</li><li>Why hang onto a bad memory when you can use it as motivation to become a better version of yourself?</li><li>Some people are meant to stay in your life forever, and others were just a brief phase. No matter what, you deserve to be happy, and it's time to give your new future a chance.</li><li>Move on by focusing on the present and future, not the past.</li><li>While some people might tell you that time heals all wounds, the truth is that you need to work through your feelings and emotions to heal from your breakups properly. It's not about forgetting what you've lost but learning to appreciate what you have.</li><li>Life is too short to be upset all the time, and waiting for your happy ever after, is a massive waste of time. It's up to you to find a way to be content in the here and now and make the most of what you have.</li><li>Remember that life doesn't always turn out the way you planned, but it's still possible to find joy in unexpected places.</li><li>Believe in yourself and make this new chapter of your life one you can look back on with pride, knowing that you took control of your destiny and refused to settle for less than what you deserved.</li><li>Don't be afraid to ask for help; lean on your friends and family when you need it.</li><li>In the end, all that matters is that you're happy, healthy, and living a life, you can be proud of.</li><li>Forgive yourself for past mistakes, but don't dwell on them either. Always look ahead and move forward in life with grace and determination.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/221f5233c4ae416b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>63 deep self-growth quotes to aid you in personal development</span></p></a><h2>Inspirational new beginning quotes</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/5cc803d255a39310.jpg><p class=align-left>It is never too late to start over and become the person you always wanted to be.
