Disapproval of his job performance stands at a record-high 72% as well.&nbsp;</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">It’s a far cry from where he stood around the same time last year, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine helped boost Macron’s approval to 42% — 19 percentage points higher than today, though still well underwater.&nbsp;</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Macron’s numbers have steadily trended negative ever since — he got re-elected in April 2022 with 58% of French adults disapproving of his job performance — though the decline has accelerated during the pension fight.</li></ul><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Why Macron may be insulated from souring public opinion</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Macron became the first French leader to win re-election since 2002, but his victory was marred by an unexpected surge in support for the left wing in June legislative elections that cost him his absolute majority in the National Assembly. He maintained control by allying with the Republicans, but when their lawmakers balked at his pension overhaul after weeks of protest, Macron took the drastic step of forcing through the legislation using Article 49.3 of the French Constitution.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Macron argues the changes are necessary to prevent a systemic crisis within the system as France’s population ages. Macron’s term-limited status may help explain why he was willing to go around the legislature: he’s already unpopular but not really in any danger of being removed from office, opening up wiggle room for him to make unpopular decisions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZLavv9Oapa1lmaPBpriOnqSmmZ6qsq15zJqpnKeeYq6xvNGorZqkXaeutbXNoA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ana-de-armas-blonde-nudity-circulate-online-1235378282.html><span>←</span><span>Ana de Armas Says Its Disgusting That Blonde Nudity Will Circulate the Internet</span></a>
