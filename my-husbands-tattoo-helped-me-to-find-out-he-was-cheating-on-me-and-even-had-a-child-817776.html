She wrote, “A&nbsp;year and a&nbsp;half ago, my&nbsp;husband got a&nbsp;tattoo. I&nbsp;don’t have a&nbsp;problem with tattoos or&nbsp;anything like that but had never gotten one before or&nbsp;talked about getting one.”</p><p>When she asked him about the reason why he&nbsp;actually decided to&nbsp;ink his body, his reply was not likely to&nbsp;cause any troubles.</p><p>The OP&nbsp;wrote, “He&nbsp;said he&nbsp;started thinking about it&nbsp;because one of&nbsp;his sisters married a&nbsp;man who had several tattoos. It&nbsp;made him realize he&nbsp;wanted one. He&nbsp;ended up&nbsp;getting a&nbsp;lily tattooed on&nbsp;the left side of&nbsp;his chest. I&nbsp;didn’t really like&nbsp;it, but&nbsp;I didn’t comment because he&nbsp;is&nbsp;free to&nbsp;do&nbsp;what he&nbsp;wants with his body.”</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;simple coincidence made the woman rethink her husband’s tattoo.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5fe/8e1/a3040454269a824e31d353cffc.jpg><p>The woman seemed to&nbsp;have forgotten about this tattoo and continued her normal life with her husband, when one day her husband decided to&nbsp;add some details to&nbsp;his tattoo.</p><p>The OP&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “A&nbsp;little over a&nbsp;year after he&nbsp;got the lily done, he&nbsp;went back and had some ivy added around&nbsp;it. I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;certain work events and parties with him because it&nbsp;was normal to&nbsp;go. He&nbsp;then started telling me&nbsp;I couldn’t go&nbsp;with him, and then&nbsp;I insisted on&nbsp;him to&nbsp;take me&nbsp;there again. He&nbsp;finally relented and brought me&nbsp;to&nbsp;one.”</p><p>Then, a&nbsp;seemingly ordinary meeting grew into a&nbsp;huge problem. The woman wrote, “I&nbsp;met one of&nbsp;his colleagues. She works in&nbsp;the same department as&nbsp;him, and they have the same title, so&nbsp;they work together a&nbsp;lot. Her name was Lily.”</p><p>The OP&nbsp;had some puzzle being solved in&nbsp;her head, but her husband said she was wrong. The woman explained, “My&nbsp;husband swore it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;coincidence. I&nbsp;had tried to&nbsp;ignore my&nbsp;feeling about him suddenly wanting a&nbsp;tattoo.”</p><p><h2>The revelations that came after that event were really stressful for the woman.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6f3/e4e/b0dfc9521e80c62aa68cc0510c.jpg><p>But soon the woman discovered that her spouse did have some huge skeleton in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cupboard. And not just one.</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “He&nbsp;eventually admitted they have been having an&nbsp;affair for the last two years. I&nbsp;was so&nbsp;shocked&nbsp;I was not even thinking about the ivy, but my&nbsp;husband said that Lily had a&nbsp;baby she named Ivy, and he&nbsp;got the tattoo a&nbsp;few months after the birth.”</p><p>When the&nbsp;OP found out about this affair and that her husband actually had a&nbsp;baby with his mistress, she of&nbsp;course thought about divorcing her husband immediately. But he&nbsp;did have a&nbsp;big hope that she’d forgive him for everything that he’d done.</p><p>The woman revealed, “He&nbsp;begged me&nbsp;not to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;<a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a>, but&nbsp;I can’t forgive this. We&nbsp;have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;separated for a&nbsp;year before we&nbsp;get divorced.”</p><p><h2>The woman now is&nbsp;totally desperate and broken.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/09d/e78/c03bab5e08a7dc4dd0bf89b193.jpg><p>The OP&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “Our daughter is&nbsp;turning 18&nbsp;next month. There will not be&nbsp;child support ordered for either of&nbsp;us by&nbsp;the time we&nbsp;are divorced. The divorce should not be&nbsp;complicated. We&nbsp;both work, so&nbsp;the attorney&nbsp;I consulted said there will not be&nbsp;spousal support ordered for either of&nbsp;us and our assets will be&nbsp;divided.”</p><p>She shared her feelings about everything that has happened to&nbsp;her, saying, “Part of&nbsp;me&nbsp;is&nbsp;still in&nbsp;shock. He&nbsp;wants to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;counseling, but&nbsp;I can’t. We&nbsp;have been married for 19&nbsp;years, and&nbsp;I let him convince me&nbsp;my&nbsp;feelings about his tattoo were wrong. I&nbsp;never thought&nbsp;I would be&nbsp;43&nbsp;and getting a&nbsp;divorce, but here I&nbsp;am.”</p><p><h2>Reddit people were very supportive in&nbsp;the comments.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/862/add/fd53a65b63ab3457ba592ba8a7.jpg><p>People in&nbsp;the comments were quick to&nbsp;react with their opinions, and some of&nbsp;them even shared their own stories.</p><p>One person <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>, “My&nbsp;ex&nbsp;got me&nbsp;pregnant, which&nbsp;I found out about after&nbsp;I left him. I&nbsp;left him because he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;terrible partner. He&nbsp;was always being inappropriate when it&nbsp;came to&nbsp;other women, and he&nbsp;was attempting to&nbsp;control&nbsp;me, and&nbsp;I wasn’t having&nbsp;it.<br>So&nbsp;I&nbsp;left him and then found out two months later that&nbsp;I was pregnant with our daughter, who is&nbsp;now 3&nbsp;weeks old. When I&nbsp;found out&nbsp;I was pregnant, I&nbsp;did what&nbsp;I thought was the right thing and let him know.<br>When he&nbsp;realized that he&nbsp;was not going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;use my&nbsp;<a href=# title=pregnancy data-link=tag>pregnancy</a> and our daughter to&nbsp;<a href=# title=manipulate data-link=tag>manipulate</a> me&nbsp;into coming back so&nbsp;that he&nbsp;could continue to&nbsp;control&nbsp;me, he&nbsp;disappeared on&nbsp;me. It’s fine because we’re both better off without him in&nbsp;our lives anyway.”</p><p>Another person <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “Good for you! What a&nbsp;massive&nbsp;ah. I’m sorry that happened. Hope you find your peace.”</p><p>And another user <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “OP, 43&nbsp;is still young, trust&nbsp;me. Surround yourself with good people, and plan yourself a&nbsp;nice vacation. You deserve to&nbsp;be&nbsp;treated with love and respect, and when you’re ready, you’ll meet someone that is&nbsp;worthy of&nbsp;that trust. I’ve been there, and it’s really painful to&nbsp;get over that kind of&nbsp;betrayal, but be&nbsp;patient with yourself, and you’ll get through&nbsp;it.”</p><p>And here’s yet another story that will give you a&nbsp;“true detective” vibes. One woman found <a href=#>a&nbsp;tampon</a> in&nbsp;her husband’s car, and the truth that she revealed about him because of&nbsp;this tampon, was far more evil than a&nbsp;simple infidelity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6eceuqpuZnpnAbsDArauop12dsq28xJ1kpp1dqbxussinm2anpal6qbGMsJisZZOdsqLAyKeeZqeeYrqmecCnm2adppq7brTAnWSaZZOdtq2wjHFocG9na3w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./transitions-fins-de-carrieres-le-gouvernement-lache-du-lest.html><span>←</span><span>le gouvernement lche du lest</span></a>
