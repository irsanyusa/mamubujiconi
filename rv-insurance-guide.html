RV insurance covers your financial responsibility if you cause an accident, and another driver suffers losses. You can also purchase optional policies that cover your RV against damage, theft and breakdowns.</p><p>Traditional auto insurance does not provide coverage for RVs that are motorized and self-powered, so RV insurance is a legal requirement. (However, when your vehicle tows a pop-up camper, a larger travel trailer, or even a fifth wheel, your auto insurance that covers the vehicle that tows that trailer typically extends to the RV.) Here’s what you need to know about RV insurance, including what it covers, how much it costs and what insurance companies sell RV insurance.</p><h2 id=what-does-rv-insurance-cover>What does RV insurance cover?</h2><p>There are several types of RV insurance available. Much like personal auto insurance, there are required coverages and optional endorsements that can provide more complete protection.</p><p>At a minimum, RV insurance includes coverage for personal liability. It provides legal and financial protection if you cause an accident and the other driver gets injured, or their vehicle gets damaged or totaled. Personal liability insurance only applies when the accident is your fault.</p><p>In <a rel=nofollow href=#>22 states and the District of Columbia</a>, RV owners are also required to carry uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance. This policy covers your losses if you get into an accident with a driver who does not have insurance or does not have enough coverage to pay for your injuries or vehicle damages.</p><p>In addition to the required policies, many RV insurance companies also sell endorsements. Here are some of the more common RV insurance endorsements available:</p><ul><li><strong>Collision insurance</strong>: If you get into an accident and you’re responsible, collision insurance will pay to repair or replace your RV.</li><li><strong>Comprehensive insurance</strong>: Comprehensive insurance pays to repair your RV after an unforeseen, non-collision incident, such as theft, vandalism, fire damage, flood damage, hail damage, or an accident with an animal.</li><li><strong>Roadside assistance</strong>: Roadside assistance covers basic RV repairs, like a flat tire change, fuel delivery, or a new battery.</li><li><strong>Personal belongings coverage</strong>: Some insurance companies sell a personal belongings endorsement, which covers the items in your RV if they get damaged or stolen.</li><li><strong>Permanent attachments coverages</strong>: If you’ve installed permanent attachments to your RV, like a porch or awning, this endorsement can provide extra protection for those features.</li><li><strong>Vacation liability insurance</strong>: If you use your RV for vacations, this policy provides additional liability protection while you’re parked in a campground or motor home park.</li></ul><h2 id=how-much-does-rv-insurance-cost>How Much Does RV Insurance Cost?</h2><p>The cost of RV insurance is different for everyone. There are many different factors that will impact your premium. According to Progressive, the <a rel=nofollow href=#>average annual RV insurance premium</a> is around $502 for a travel trailer and $848 for a motorhome. For a minimum coverage RV insurance policy, annual rates start at $125.</p><p>Before you purchase an RV insurance policy, it’s a good idea to shop around and get several RV insurance quotes. The cost of RV insurance can vary between insurance companies for the same types and amounts of coverage. Comparing quotes can help you find the most affordable policy for your personal situation.</p><h2 id=what-affects-your-rv-insurance-rate>What Affects Your RV Insurance Rate?</h2><p>Insurance companies look at a variety of criteria when calculating your RV insurance premium. Some of the factors that can affect your premium include:</p><ul><li>Location</li><li>Type of RV</li><li>Age of RV</li><li>Types of coverage</li><li>Coverage limits</li><li>Deductibles</li><li>Claim history</li><li>Driving history</li><li>RV usage</li><li>RV driving experience</li></ul><h2 id=where-to-get-rv-insurance>Where to Get RV Insurance</h2><p>Many national and regional insurance providers sell RV insurance. Here are some of the biggest insurance companies that sell coverage for RVs:</p><ul><li>Progressive</li><li>State Farm</li><li>Geico</li><li>Allstate</li><li>The Hartford</li><li>Nationwide</li><li>Liberty Mutual</li><li>Farmers</li><li>USAA</li></ul><p>In addition, there are also several insurance companies that specialize in RV insurance. These insurers exclusively sell insurance policies for RVs and motorhomes. Here are several companies to consider:</p><ul><li>RV America Insurance</li><li>Good Sam Insurance</li><li>Roamly</li><li>Family Motor Coach Association (FMCA)</li></ul><h2 id=how-to-lower-your-rv-insurance-premium>How to Lower Your RV Insurance Premium</h2><p>RV insurance premiums can be expensive, especially if you own a newer motorhome, or if you live in the RV full-time. However, there are ways to save money on your RV insurance costs. Consider these savings opportunities when you purchase coverage:</p><ul><li><strong>Ask about discounts</strong>: Some RV insurance companies offer discounts, which can help you lock in a lower premium. You can often find discounts for having no recent claims, taking an RV safety course, having continuous RV insurance, and having no claims on your record.</li><li><strong>Drive safely</strong>: You can usually qualify for a discount if you have no recent accidents or traffic violations on your record.</li><li><strong>Bundle your policies</strong>: Most RV insurance providers will offer a discount on your premium if you purchase RV insurance and auto insurance or homeowners insurance together.</li><li><strong>Pay in full</strong>: When you pay your annual RV insurance premium upfront and in full, many insurers will give you an automatic discount.</li><li><strong>Get multiple quotes</strong>: Shopping around and getting multiple RV insurance quotes can help you find the cheapest rate.</li></ul><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Does RV insurance include roadside coverage?</h3><p>Most RV insurance policies don’t include roadside assistance. If you want this coverage, you must add it as an endorsement. While getting roadside assistance will increase your premium, it can provide valuable protection, especially if you don’t already have coverage through a service like AAA.</p><h3>Does RV insurance cover theft of personal items?</h3><p>Some RV insurance policies cover theft of personal items, but it depends on the specific policy. Some insurance companies also sell a separate endorsement that provides more complete protection for stolen personal items. You should check with your RV insurance company to see what is and is not covered.</p><h3>Is RV insurance more expensive than car insurance?</h3><p>In general, RV insurance is less expensive than car insurance. However, bigger RVs and new RVs with a high value can have costly premiums. To see how much you will pay for RV insurance, you can get personalized quotes from different insurers. Comparing rate quotes can help you find the most affordable policy.</p><h3>Do I really need RV insurance?</h3><p>If you own an RV, you need RV insurance. It’s a legal requirement in almost every state, regardless of how often you use the motorhome, or how far you travel. Without RV insurance, you can face serious legal and financial consequences if you cause an accident or get caught driving uninsured. Remember—your personal car insurance policy generally extends basic liability coverage to travel trailers, pop-up campers, or other trailers attached to the hitch of your vehicle. However, many people opt for additional RV insurance that will protect them from financial woes in the case of theft, fire, or major damage to another motorist or yourself that your current auto insurance doesn’t fully cover. When in doubt, check your policy and shop around!</p><p>The information presented here is created independently from the TIME editorial staff.
