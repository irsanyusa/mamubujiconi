Here is a list of the most painful piercings, from the least to the most painful.</p><h3 id=1593892-1-earlobe class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>1. Earlobe</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/14d7eeedd235af31.jpeg><p class=align-left>Ear lobe piercing is the most common and the least painful because of the fleshy nature of the lobe. Many claim it is no more painful than a bee sting, lasting only a few seconds.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/e72581eddf287535.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Smiley piercing: What you need to know before you get one</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Lobe piercings are simple to take care of, requiring you to clean them with cotton buds and salt water. In six weeks, your ear lobe should be healed.</p><h3 id=1593892-2-navel class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>2. Navel</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/e72581eddf287535.jpeg><p class=align-left>Navel piercings are the second most popular type of body piercings. When one gets their navel pierced, they report feeling as if they have been stung by a bee and experiencing some soreness just after.</p><p class=align-left>Exercise caution when choosing what to wear, as the piercing will take time to heal. Proper aftercare is crucial to promote <a id=https://www.legit.ng/1204025-best-messages-him.html href=#>quick healing</a>, which can take up to six months. Avoid workouts that involve stomach movement, as they may injure the pierced area.</p><h3 id=1593892-3-lip class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>3. Lip</h3><p class=align-left>Getting your lip pierced is painless. It involves puncturing the skin with a needle, marking the location with a pen, and inserting a labret stud once the lip has been secured with a small metal clamp.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/70628a36bcc36cca.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Helix piercing cheat sheet: All you need to know before you get one</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Your lip is made of soft, fleshy material, which is one reason it is less painful. There may be some soreness and swelling after the piercing, but this should subside in two weeks. It heals fully in six to eight weeks.</p><h3 id=1593892-4-nostril class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>4. Nostril</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/6609e4c2e75ee0c3.jpeg><p class=align-left>These <a href=#>nose piercings</a> hurt more than navel, lip, and earlobe piercings. Cartilage is stiffer than flesh, and the needle must pass through it. Many report that it hurts for a moment, and they get watery eyes or feel like they need to sneeze.</p><p class=align-left>After the piercing, clean it with salt water so it should not be too painful. They take six to eight weeks to heal.</p><h3 id=1593892-5-eyebrow class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>5. Eyebrow</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/70628a36bcc36cca.jpeg><p class=align-left>Eyebrow piercings are low on the piercing pain chart. This is because hardly much skin needs to be punctured by the needle. The area is full of nerve endings, making it more sensitive. <a href=#>People</a> describe the procedure feels more like pressure and a sharp pinch.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/5dfe9f47630eed78.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nose piercing 101: what you need to know before you get one</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Eyebrow piercings take three months to heal. Therefore, it is crucial to exercise caution when plucking eyebrows and be careful when dressing or taking clothes off.</p><h3 id=1593892-6-tongue class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>6. Tongue</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/2932039028bd4943.jpeg><p class=align-left>Although tongue piercings are not considered painful, it is important to remember they may cause more after-effects than others. It is because they frequently swell, which can cause temporary difficulties with eating and speaking.</p><p class=align-left>It is best to consider when to get your piercing done. Avoid times you need to talk and consider scheduling it for the weekend so you will have time for the swelling to go down before heading to work or school. The swelling should subside in a few days.</p><h3 id=1593892-7-daith class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>7. Daith</h3><p class=align-left>The daith piercing has become more popular because it has been linked to its potential use for other purposes. A pressure point connected to daith piercings may help reduce the frequency and intensity of migraine attacks.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/2b86909c9b4dae94.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rook piercing fact sheet: Pain, healing time, meaning and more</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The daith piercing is more painful and uncomfortable than the lobe piercing as it goes through the innermost ear cartilage. It takes three to six months to heal.</p><h3 id=1593892-8-helix class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>8. Helix</h3><p class=align-left>The helix is a cartilage piercing inserted at the top of your ear. Because it is made of cartilage, more pressure is needed to puncture the hole. This piercing is around the centre of the piercing pain chart.</p><p class=align-left>A <a href=#>helix piercing</a> requires a strict saline cleaning regimen to ensure the best possible outcome. If clean and safe, a helix piercing can heal in three months. However, some have reported that it took up to six months to recover completely.</p><h3 id=1593892-9-dermal-anchor class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>9. Dermal anchor</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/3363761a3c2418c7.jpeg><p class=align-left>One of the <a id=https://www.legit.ng/ask-legit/tv-shows-movies/1534569-40-hot-male-actors-attractive-men-hollywood-beyond/ href=#>most attractive</a> body piercings available is dermal anchors, which many choose to have on their cheeks, hands, and chest. The pain threshold for persons who have had dermal anchoring is reportedly 6/10.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/64e08d765d9aa155.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Tragus piercing 101: everything you need to know about them</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Getting a dermal anchor requires punching a hole beneath the skin and putting the anchor's base within the freshly punched hole. The procedure takes a little longer than a lip piercing, which adds to the pain level.</p><h3 id=1593892-10-rook class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>10. Rook</h3><p class=align-left>Also called a smoke piercing, it is done on the inner portion of the ear, especially in the "smoke" cartilaginous fold. The needle passes through the little bendy portion toward the top of your ear. There will be discomfort when the needle penetrates the cartilage, but it should not linger too long.</p><p class=align-left>Because of its location on the ear, the rook is harder to irritate than the Helix, which allows easier aftercare. Depending on each person's reaction, a <a href=#>rook piercing</a> should heal in three to nine months.</p><h3 id=1593892-11-conch class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>11. Conch</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/5dfe9f47630eed78.jpeg><p class=align-left>One of the most painful ear piercings is conch piercing because it is inserted directly through the ear shell. The cartilage is slightly thicker, and there is less flesh in it. People report feeling more pressure and pain during the piercing, even though it is quick.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/b0af868336fc5a91.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30 trendiest teen boy haircuts you definitely have to try</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This piercing needs a proper cleaning regimen with salt water as it heals similarly to the helix and rook piercings. It heals within three to six months.</p><h3 id=1593892-12-industrial class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>12. Industrial</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/91ff35e6831dfc66.jpeg><p class=align-left>Industrial piercings are more painful since they penetrate two sets of ear cartilage. Due to its location, it might be simple to irritate the piercing, increasing the pain. Regular salt water washing and avoiding irritants like hairspray are essential to fasten the healing process. Depending on each person's response, healing can take three to nine months.</p><h3 id=1593892-13-septum class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>13. Septum</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/2b86909c9b4dae94.jpeg><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>septum</a> piercing is a contentious procedure since some people say it hurts very little, while others say it hurts a lot. The degree of discomfort experienced is influenced by where the piercing is placed.</p><p class=align-left>The piercing <a href=#>industry</a> refers to the soft skin inside the nostrils as "the sweet spot." It is where the piercing should pass through. Although it heals within six to eight months, you should only feel pain and tenderness for about a week.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/809b5286f1db2bf2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Is a septum piercing painful?

Teat</h3><p class=align-left>Teats are among the most painful piercings as they are highly concentrated with nerve endings. How sensitive your teats are determines how painful they are for you. Individuals with less sensitive teats experience less pain than those with more sensitive ones.</p><p class=align-left>People with teat piercings claim it feels like a brief pinch or bite. The teat may be sore or swollen for the first few days following the procedure. They can take up to a year to heal, necessitating frequent saltwater washing.</p><h3 id=1593892-15-private-part-piercing class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>15. Private part piercing</h3><p class=align-left>The most painful piercings are those on the female private parts. This is due to the heightened sensitivity and abundance of nerve endings in your private part.</p><p class=align-left>You should visit a piercer who has received training in performing private part piercings to minimise the amount of pain you might feel. Due to the high blood flow, they should heal within eight weeks on average.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/511499a675332faf.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ profound Bible verses about the tongue to help mind your speech</span></p></a><h2 id=1593892-what-are-the-most-painful-piercings class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>What are the most painful piercings?</h2><p class=align-left>Certain piercings hurt more than others.
