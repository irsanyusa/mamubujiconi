No, he’s not afraid of&nbsp;his reflection.</p><p>He’s just remembered the scariest day of&nbsp;his life. It’s been thirty years, and he&nbsp;still can’t look at&nbsp;mirrors without fear.

They want to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;break from the bustling city and hard work. Lucy finds a&nbsp;perfect place on&nbsp;the web. They book a&nbsp;<strong>cozy house right next to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lake</strong> for a&nbsp;modest price.<strong></strong></p><p>They’re delighted with such luck and pay two days in&nbsp;advance without looking at&nbsp;the lease terms.<strong> </strong>The couple get into the <a href=# title=car data-link=tag>car</a>. They’re smiling, and Matt is&nbsp;pressing the gas pedal. They don’t yet know what a&nbsp;nightmare is&nbsp;coming for them.</p><p>Our heroes arrive at&nbsp;the place. The reality looks exactly like the picture on&nbsp;the website&nbsp;— it’s a&nbsp;beautiful two-story house right next to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lake and a&nbsp;<a href=# title=forest data-link=tag>forest</a>. Everything looks great, but the owner is&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;weird. He’s a&nbsp;tall old man with a&nbsp;sly grin.</p><p>He&nbsp;gives the keys to&nbsp;Matt and Lucy and wishes them to&nbsp;have fun. Then, the owner gets on&nbsp;the motorcycle and drives off. Matt and Lucy check the house and look around the neighborhood. Matt notices video cameras hanging on&nbsp;the trees. It&nbsp;seems the owner put them there for safety. “Hope nothing like that is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the house,” Lucy jokes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/33c/b20/e5588c541796004d133a2261ad.jpeg><p>In&nbsp;the evening, they cook dinner and watch a&nbsp;movie. Matt walks into the bathroom. He&nbsp;washes his face, and drops of&nbsp;<a href=# title=water data-link=tag>water</a> bounce to&nbsp;the mirror. He&nbsp;wipes the glass with his finger and notices something creepy. He&nbsp;touches his nail tip to&nbsp;the reflective surface, and... there’s no&nbsp;gap.</p><p>Matt knows for sure if&nbsp;there’s a&nbsp;small distance between the nail and its reflection, it’s a&nbsp;<strong>real mirror</strong>. But if&nbsp;the finger “touches” the reflection when there’s almost no&nbsp;distance, it’s <strong>a&nbsp;fake</strong> two-way <strong>mirror</strong>. This is&nbsp;when you see yourself, but someone on&nbsp;the other side is&nbsp;watching you.</p><p>To&nbsp;know for sure, Matt presses his eyes against the mirror, cupping his hands around them, so&nbsp;the light wouldn’t interfere with the view. He’s trying to&nbsp;see something on&nbsp;the other side. And he&nbsp;notices. Matt’s sure there’s another space behind the mirror. And somebody’s looking at&nbsp;him. Shocked, he&nbsp;removes it&nbsp;from the wall and discovers a&nbsp;small dark room. What the...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/66f/958/6101b45c2d87d82c4467afc522.jpeg><p>A&nbsp;jolt surges through his body as&nbsp;he&nbsp;hears Lucy’s scream from the neighboring room. Matt runs to&nbsp;her. She looks scared and points at&nbsp;the window. Matt sees the house owner watching them from the forest. Matt grabs Lucy’s hand and leads her to&nbsp;the exit. “We’re leaving this place now.” He&nbsp;presses the handle, but the door won’t open.</p><p>He&nbsp;tries to&nbsp;put the key in&nbsp;the lock, but something gets in&nbsp;the way. In&nbsp;most cases, when the key doesn’t fit, you just need to&nbsp;grease the lock. But if&nbsp;the problem appears suddenly, you need to&nbsp;replace&nbsp;it. This is&nbsp;because someone tried to&nbsp;crack it&nbsp;to&nbsp;get into your house. But also, somebody could insert a&nbsp;microphone or&nbsp;other device into the lock to&nbsp;eavesdrop on&nbsp;you.</p><p>Matt tries to&nbsp;get out through the window, but it’s locked from the outside. He&nbsp;throws a&nbsp;chair into the glass, but it’s bulletproof. What’s going on&nbsp;here?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/77b/cd9/dd359852a6a36bcd38b18b19ef.jpeg><p>They look around and notice something else. On&nbsp;the floor, near the wall, there’s dust and dirt. Check the wall if&nbsp;you see dust like this in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=hotel data-link=tag>hotel</a> or&nbsp;in&nbsp;someone else’s house. This debris indicates that someone was working with a&nbsp;drill to&nbsp;install a&nbsp;recording device. Also, if&nbsp;you see an&nbsp;electric socket is&nbsp;installed unevenly, a&nbsp;microphone or&nbsp;a&nbsp;camera may be&nbsp;hidden behind&nbsp;it.</p><p>There’s a&nbsp;lamp hanging on&nbsp;the wall. Matt takes it&nbsp;off and sees a&nbsp;small microphone. This little thing and the fake double mirror. There must be&nbsp;cameras somewhere.</p><p>Surveillance devices are often installed in&nbsp;the bedroom and bathroom, inside mirrors, and under the sink. Inspect all corners in&nbsp;these rooms, including smoke detectors, and air vents. Usually, they put tiny cameras and recorders in&nbsp;switches, corners of&nbsp;shelves, and behind interior elements. The most common cliché is&nbsp;plush toys.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/c39/a1d/eecac35087b0e07b631bb7a305.jpeg><p>If&nbsp;you don’t want to&nbsp;check the room like that, you can follow Lucy’s example. She switches the light off and turns on&nbsp;the flashlight on&nbsp;her phone. Any camera lens will flash in&nbsp;the dark if&nbsp;you point a&nbsp;beam of&nbsp;light at&nbsp;it. You will definitely notice&nbsp;it.</p><p>Also, the front camera of&nbsp;your phone can detect infrared light coming from the lenses. Inspect the entire room with&nbsp;it, and you’ll see a&nbsp;tiny flash on&nbsp;the screen. Matt and Lucy find several cameras in&nbsp;the living room, one in&nbsp;the bathroom installed in&nbsp;the shower, and two in&nbsp;the bedroom.</p><p>There’s another way to&nbsp;find these devices. Almost all modern hidden cameras work via Wi-Fi. You can download special apps that scan the area and detect surveillance tools connected to&nbsp;the Internet. So, if&nbsp;you think somebody’s watching, you can just disconnect the Wi-Fi router from the outlet. Matt and Lucy do&nbsp;just that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/296/498/5cc9c35c0aa6d4b40b922bf7e3.jpeg><p>Matt is&nbsp;about to&nbsp;call the police, but the phone doesn’t work well for some reason. He&nbsp;was so&nbsp;keen on&nbsp;finding cameras that he&nbsp;forgot the main thing&nbsp;— <strong>digital security</strong>. One of&nbsp;the most common ways to&nbsp;get into your phone is&nbsp;Wi-Fi.</p><p>Don’t connect to&nbsp;unknown spots. When you do&nbsp;this, you automatically grant permission to&nbsp;access your device. Criminals can listen to&nbsp;your conversations, steal your data, and disrupt work. Also, never open unknown files and links. Matt and Lucy connected to&nbsp;Wi-Fi when they got inside the house.<strong></strong></p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, they can’t make calls now. Locked in&nbsp;the big house, surrounded by&nbsp;hidden cameras, the heroes think about what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;next. Matt goes to&nbsp;the bathroom and walks into the small room behind the fake mirror. There’s one chair and an&nbsp;iron door. It’s locked.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lucy examines the ceiling in&nbsp;the living room and notices an&nbsp;air vent. Perhaps she can go&nbsp;outside through&nbsp;it. She’s sure that she will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;crawl in&nbsp;there and call for help.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/96b/eda/744adb55e580c8c7df3cc90a6f.jpeg><p>Matt stands on&nbsp;a&nbsp;chair and removes the lid... “Hello there,”&nbsp;— the scary owner says. His head is&nbsp;looking at&nbsp;Matt right out of&nbsp;the vent. Lucy screams in&nbsp;horror. Matt falls off the chair.</p><p>He&nbsp;stands&nbsp;up, takes Lucy’s hand, and runs away with her to&nbsp;the other end of&nbsp;the room. The man gets out of&nbsp;the ventilation. Matt throws a&nbsp;chair at&nbsp;him. “Get away from&nbsp;us, you lunatic!”</p><p>The owner doesn’t understand what’s happening. “You destroyed all the cameras. How do&nbsp;you think&nbsp;I can watch you?” he&nbsp;asks. “What the...???” Matt answers in&nbsp;shock. “Wait a&nbsp;minute. You didn’t read the lease terms, did you?”&nbsp;— the owner is&nbsp;surprised.</p><p>He&nbsp;put cameras and microphones inside the house, and it’s written on&nbsp;the website. Some people like to&nbsp;be&nbsp;watched. The owner thought Matt and Lucy were one of&nbsp;them. He&nbsp;shakes his head, opens the door, and lets them&nbsp;go.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/45d/4f0/148278543b83e7e2fd50a4de95.jpeg><p>They get in&nbsp;the car, check the website of&nbsp;this house, and... the entry about it&nbsp;is&nbsp;removed. Was there really any info about surveillance? They will never know. And they will never forget this weekend.</p><p>From now&nbsp;on, they will always read the terms of&nbsp;the lease. The owner of&nbsp;the house looks after the departing car with a&nbsp;smile. Yeah, sometimes it&nbsp;happens for real. Some people install cameras in&nbsp;their houses. But they must indicate this in&nbsp;the description. So&nbsp;always read the terms.</p><p>It’s illegal to&nbsp;install cameras and microphones without the knowledge of&nbsp;residents. Robbers can install hidden cameras not only in&nbsp;houses but also in&nbsp;public places. So, be&nbsp;careful at&nbsp;ATMs.</p><p>It’s common knowledge that you need to&nbsp;cover the button panel with your hand when you enter the PIN. But not only because strangers can see&nbsp;it. Criminals can put a&nbsp;little hidden camera directly into the ATM and thus see your PIN.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/9d3/a36/9196565a6d9ed8cb5c8ce26663.jpeg><p>Yes, cameras can get you nervous, but they also have a&nbsp;huge benefit. Cameras in&nbsp;buses, subway cars, trams, for example. They not only monitor the order and detect violators but also watch the condition of&nbsp;drivers.</p><p>Now, most cameras don’t just record. They’re equipped with artificial intelligence and various sensors. If&nbsp;you’re driving and want to&nbsp;sleep, the camera will see&nbsp;it. The device will give a&nbsp;loud signal to&nbsp;bring you to&nbsp;your senses.</p><p>Cameras recognize faces, which helps catch scammers, thieves, and hooligans. Such surveillance reduces the number of&nbsp;violations of&nbsp;the law. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;city camera breaks down, the program informs the special services.</p><p>And the coolest thing is&nbsp;special sites where you can access many street cameras around the world. Just like that, you can observe what’s happening on&nbsp;the other side of&nbsp;the globe from your computer.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGwwcKhZLKnpad6rrXRq6arZaSkeqy6zrBkop5dqLyusc6nnKxlp5bBpLTIp55msZ%2Bqenl9knBvamc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1314307-top-50-funny-star-wars-memes-true-fans-saga-html.html><span>←</span><span>Top 50 funny Star Wars memes for the true fans of the saga</span></a>
