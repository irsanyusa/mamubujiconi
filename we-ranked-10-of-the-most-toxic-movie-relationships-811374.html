But some of&nbsp;the most well-known and adored movie couples are also examples of&nbsp;toxic behaviors. Sometimes imaginary care hides aggressive behavior and a&nbsp;desire to&nbsp;dominate. And at&nbsp;first glance, innocuous quarrels cover up&nbsp;a&nbsp;desire to&nbsp;assert themselves at&nbsp;the expense of&nbsp;a&nbsp;partner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cd3/ffa/c238c251e187d6b63b036a62cb.jpg><p>Jack and Rose’s relationship has been melting hearts worldwide for more than 20&nbsp;years. But they actually make a&nbsp;terrible couple when you think about&nbsp;it. From the time that Jack saves Rose from jumping off the Titanic to&nbsp;the moment he&nbsp;freezes in&nbsp;the Atlantic Ocean, only a&nbsp;little over 48&nbsp;hours passes. Love is&nbsp;something that takes time to&nbsp;develop, and two days is&nbsp;simply not enough.</p><p>That brings&nbsp;us to&nbsp;the fact that they were in&nbsp;lust rather than love. Although Jack and Rose have great chemistry, they don’t share much. Their differences may eventually cause major problems if&nbsp;Jack had survived the sinking, and they had run away together to&nbsp;New York.</p><p><strong>What’s wrong: </strong>Passion was mistaken for love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/037/ffe/ef5a715827a97f2dae32db94b1.jpg><p>It&nbsp;took time to&nbsp;understand that Miranda Priestly is&nbsp;not the main villain in&nbsp;this iconic movie. Nate is&nbsp;not just an&nbsp;unsupportive boyfriend. He’s a&nbsp;selfish, whiny man-child who thinks his birthday is&nbsp;more important than Andy’s career. He&nbsp;abandoned her when she needed him most because she prioritized her goals and dreams.</p><p>The first <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>comment</a> he&nbsp;makes to&nbsp;Andy after she finds out she got a&nbsp;job at&nbsp;a&nbsp;fashion magazine&nbsp;is, “Was it&nbsp;a&nbsp;phone interview?” He&nbsp;literally thinks Andy can’t work at&nbsp;Runway! Nate just doesn’t deserve her.</p><p><strong>What’s wrong: </strong>Nate is&nbsp;an&nbsp;immature egomaniac, holding Andy back from her true potential.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/238/91a/0ea5715e07a055d91796080ff0.jpg><p>Romeo and Juliet’s central couple is&nbsp;still considered the gold romance standard, but this story is&nbsp;toxic. As&nbsp;young teenagers who are pretty immature, they mistake infatuation for one true love and marry within days.</p><p><strong>What’s wrong: </strong>This is&nbsp;another case of&nbsp;“love at&nbsp;first sight,” which could’ve easily been an&nbsp;attraction, lust, or&nbsp;simply the sheer adrenaline of&nbsp;rebellion. Their relationship becomes all-consuming from the start, ending with them giving their lives for a&nbsp;relationship that doesn’t even last a&nbsp;week.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/06d/f6d/26212a5d5e94e854593c1c8504.jpg><p>Their relationship is&nbsp;built upon lies from both sides. While they were initially happy together, they have become trapped in&nbsp;a&nbsp;marriage that they both find suffocating and unfulfilling.</p><p><strong>What’s wrong: </strong>They spend the bulk of&nbsp;the movie trying to&nbsp;kill each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/696/9be/304cef5f4db3098bcec2836e20.jpg><p>Rachel and Ross are one of&nbsp;the most beloved couples in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;TV shows. Their relationship was a&nbsp;roller coaster of&nbsp;emotions. Reputedly, Ross was a&nbsp;lousy partner to&nbsp;Rachel. He&nbsp;was constantly putting others in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;their relationships, using other women to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;get over her.</p><p>With all the lies and <a href=# title=manipulations data-link=tag>manipulations</a> he&nbsp;used in&nbsp;their relationship, Ross acted like a&nbsp;controlling boyfriend. Despite her request, he&nbsp;refused to&nbsp;divorce Rachel after they got married by&nbsp;accident in&nbsp;Vegas. Ross often showed that he&nbsp;felt like he&nbsp;owned Rachel, which is&nbsp;not romantic.</p><p><strong>What’s wrong: </strong>Toxic relationships with jealousy, cheating, and manipulations. They don’t allow each other to&nbsp;move&nbsp;on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cf3/660/7d44bc577d9efb84c0cd23a66e.jpg><p>Mr. Big, or&nbsp;it’s better to&nbsp;say Mr. Big Waste of&nbsp;Time. Their toxic, on-and-off relationship had more downs than ups. Carrie has a&nbsp;bad habit of&nbsp;assuming her partners will figure out what she wants without telling them.</p><p>When the two began dating, Carrie noticed that he&nbsp;frequently took her to&nbsp;hidden restaurants so&nbsp;nobody they knew would bump into them. He&nbsp;ditches Carrie and lets go&nbsp;of&nbsp;their relationship countless times. It’s enough to&nbsp;remember the scene when he&nbsp;abandoned Carrie at&nbsp;the altar.</p><p><strong>What’s wrong: </strong>Their problems are pretty similar to&nbsp;Ross and Rachel, but much more emotionally manipulative because Mr. Big has been playing with Carrie for years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3ce/528/ca51cf577fac8dd0a727f91d8b.jpg><p>Despite its immense popularity, the <i>Twilight</i> saga&nbsp;— in&nbsp;which <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>17-year-old</a> Bella falls in&nbsp;love with a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>104-year-old</a> vampire, Edward Cullen&nbsp;— is&nbsp;inarguably toxic in&nbsp;several ways. And the age gap is&nbsp;just the tip of&nbsp;the iceberg. Bella is&nbsp;younger and isn’t sure what she really deserves. In&nbsp;contrast, Edward shows&nbsp;us many stereotypical characteristics of&nbsp;a&nbsp;toxic partner.</p><p>First and foremost, he&nbsp;consciously tries to&nbsp;isolate her, including from her father and friends. Edward doesn’t respect Bella’s boundaries, he&nbsp;stalks her on&nbsp;multiple occasions, breaks into her house, and watches her sleep every night. All these examples are romanticized in&nbsp;the film.</p><p><strong>What’s wrong: </strong>Edward has turned Bella into a&nbsp;different kind of&nbsp;creature that cannot be&nbsp;undone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/817/d64/3cc2f3588594d86d567ec75e35.jpeg><p>While the<i> Fifty Shades </i>franchise was highly appreciated for its progressive topic, this relationship isn’t healthy. The power dynamic is&nbsp;off right from the beginning. Anna is&nbsp;also an&nbsp;inexperienced and insecure girl with no&nbsp;prior relationship experience, and Christian takes advantage of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Christian Grey is&nbsp;a&nbsp;jealous and possessive man who goes all the way to&nbsp;control Ana’s life. He’s stalking her, obsessed with her whereabouts and who she’s with. If&nbsp;that’s not creepy enough, he&nbsp;bought the company she works&nbsp;at.</p><p><strong>What’s wrong: </strong>Christian is&nbsp;a&nbsp;toxic partner; their horrible relationship is&nbsp;based on&nbsp;dominance and psychological issues.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d46/6a4/7c91eb5574b27c63d3f721fc05.jpg><p>Chuck and Blair had cute moments, but it&nbsp;wasn’t enough to&nbsp;make up&nbsp;for their toxic relationship. When Blair chooses another man over him, he&nbsp;turns to&nbsp;Gossip Girl, where he&nbsp;spills all of&nbsp;Blair’s secrets about her life, destroying Blair’s reputation.</p><p>Chuck even said that seeing her suffer gave him immense pleasure, adding that he&nbsp;would not stop until she had “nothing”. Blair already had insecurity issues due to&nbsp;her mother’s relationship, and her friendship with Serena and Chuck exacerbated them.</p><p><strong>What’s wrong: </strong>Their love affair was a&nbsp;manipulative, emotionally and physically exhausting experience for Blair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/1e8/ed1/39e2365f80b9e04fba20b8a627.jpeg><p>Their relationship is&nbsp;problematic from the beginning. Allie says no&nbsp;to&nbsp;Noah’s advances when they meet at&nbsp;a&nbsp;fair. So&nbsp;he&nbsp;takes it&nbsp;upon himself to&nbsp;hang from a&nbsp;Ferris wheel, where Allie sits, and threatens to&nbsp;jump until she agrees to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out with him. It’s manipulative behavior, not romantic at&nbsp;all.</p><p>They often have arguments that turn into fights during their summer fling. It&nbsp;just confirms how crazy they are for each other. When they finally reunite after <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>14&nbsp;years</a> of&nbsp;no&nbsp;contact, Noah encourages Allie to&nbsp;start an&nbsp;affair with him and cheat on&nbsp;her fiancée. Just making this one of&nbsp;many films to&nbsp;romanticize infidelity.</p><p><strong>What’s wrong: </strong>Noah<strong> </strong>is&nbsp;a&nbsp;manipulator and a&nbsp;gaslighter who eventually tricks Allie into falling in&nbsp;love, changing her life forever. Physical fights.</p><p>Who is&nbsp;your favorite on-screen movie couple of&nbsp;all time? What behavior is&nbsp;an&nbsp;immediate red flag for you in&nbsp;relationships?
