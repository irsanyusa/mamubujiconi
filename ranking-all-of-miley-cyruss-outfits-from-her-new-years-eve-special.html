Her outfits ranged from playful to all-out glam, and she even handled a wardrobe malfunction like a total pro. We thought it would be fun to rank everything she wore from worst to best.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-the-silver-two-piece>7. The Silver Two-Piece</h2><p>This outfit already looked like it was coming apart by design when Cyrus performed “We Can’t Stop” with rapper 24KGoldn. So it was no surprise that the top ending up falling off the singer at the start of her “Party in the USA” performance. Cyrus ended up letting the top fall to the ground while covering her chest and running backstage for a quick fix. We’ll get to that a little later.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>6. The Black Mini Dress</h3><p>For her performance with Brandi Carlile, Cyrus gave herself a rocker edge with a short black dress adorned with gold chains. She paired the look with black boots, which had their own chains. It was cool, but it didn’t look any more special than something you could get at the mall.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. The Colorful Coat</h3><p>For her opening performance of Will Smith’s “Miami” with co-host Pete Davidson, Cyrus wore a glittery blue bra, a striped purple skirt, and a fluffy multi-color jacket. Was it silly? Yes. Did she kind of look like a little girl playing dress-up, or possible a Muppet? Also yes. But it was totally Miley, and isn’t New Year’s the time to go all-out?</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>MILEY CYRUS DANCES WITH ‘RUPAUL’S DRAG RACE’ QUEEN KYLIE SONIQUE DURING CONCERT</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. The Red Catsuit with Matching Jacket</h3><p>Cyrus got sleek for her performance of “Heart of Glass” by Blondie, mashed up with her own song “Plastic Hearts.” She paired a red catsuit with an oversized red jacket and red gloves. It was a killer look that totally fit with the style of the performance. However, as much as I love that jacket, I wish she had taken it off halfway through to show off the catsuit more.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. The Wardrobe Malfunction Save</h3><p>Speaking of that red jacket, it came to the rescue after Cyrus’ wardrobe malfunction. She stepped backstage after shedding her silver top and soon emerged wearing the jacket with the silver skirt. It was a totally unexpected and actually really awesome look that was even better than the original. Talk about a happy accident!</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. The Sheer Red Dress with Feathers</h3><p>Cyrus closed the show with a <a href=#>performance of her new song “You,”</a> and she wore a showstopper of a dress. The sheer red gown featured huge sleeves decorated with purple feathers, making Cyrus look like an old Hollywood star lounging in her fancy apartment. It was the perfect outfit to end the night, but there was still one more look that edged it out of first place.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. The Silver Fringe Jumpsuit</h3><p>Cyrus teamed up with her sister Noah for a performance of “Jolene” by Dolly Parton, who happens to be Cyrus’ godmother. The singer totally dressed the part, wearing a silver jumpsuit covered in fringe, with a pointy lapel. The outfit shimmered when she moved, making her look like a chic disco ball. Cyrus’ silver eyeshadow and platinum hair were the perfect accessories to an amazing look.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/NUP_195984_08522.jpeg alt="Girl Named Tom Announces an Album in the Works, Possible 2023 Tour" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>miley cyrus</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570ZqlpKGenHqiuMtmpp9lnZ65psWMnLCrraOoerDB05%2Bgratdm7%2BwuYyhnKtlnprEbsXEmqmsZZWrsm6%2Fz56aopmcZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pedro-pascals-emotional-response-to-his-sisters-coming-out-journey-812297.html><span>←</span><span>Pedro Pascals Emotional Response to His Sisters Coming Out Journey</span></a>
