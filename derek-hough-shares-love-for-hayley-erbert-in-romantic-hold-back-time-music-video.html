The six-time <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> champion compiled all his and Erbert’s adventure clips together. The visualizer is also captioned with an emotional love letter for the DWTS troupe member whom he tied the knot with in a regal Redwood Forest in Northern California.</p><p>“I sat down at the piano, thinking about our relationship and the massive step of committing my life to you,” he wrote. “The amount of life we have already shared is pretty incredible. This video is a just a tiny snippet of what we’ve already experienced. Life seems to be moving so fast, I want to hold back time as much as I possibly can to savor each and every moment with you.”</p><p>Hough ended his letter by stating that he can’t wait to continue “building memories and a beautiful life” with his then-fiancé. Erbert, meanwhile, took the time to respond in the comments.</p><p>“I love you from the deepest depths of my heart. Thank you for choosing me in this life,” she wrote.</p><p>The DWTS judge dropped the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Hold Back Time</a>” on Spotify and Apple Music on August 21. He is credited as a writer of the track, with Dustin Brian Burnett as the composer. Furthermore, the song was produced by Burnett and Zayde Wølf.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-can-t-help-but-gush-over-the-sweet-video>Fans Can’t Help But Gush Over the Sweet Video</h2><p>Upon watching the music video, fans expressed their happiness for the couple’s love story in the comments. Several users have also given their well wishes for Hough and Erbert married life.</p><p>“Thank you for sharing your journey with us. You guys are so special and it’s been a honor to see your love develop and grow,” one person wrote.</p><p>“The ‘you and me, me and you’ that’s what it will always come down to. You two together vs the world. Sending so much love to you two as you start the new journey,” another person commented.</p><p>Hough and Erbert first met in 2014 when Hough and his sister <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Julianne</a> hired Erbert for a tour. They started dating in 2015 when they were both on Dancing With The Stars.
