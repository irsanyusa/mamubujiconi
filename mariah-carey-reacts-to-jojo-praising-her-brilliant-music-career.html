She gushed about <a href=# class=broken_link>Carey’s unique vocal style</a> and her songwriting skills. JoJo’s interview caught the attention of Carey herself on Twitter.</strong></p><p>“She is so brilliant, like not only one of the most phenomenal singers from her range to her flexibility,” JoJo said. “Just chops, chops, chops, chops in general. But songwriting? Whew, this woman gave us new vocabulary words that she just expanded my mind as a child.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mariah-carey-is-one-of-jojo-s-biggest-inspirations>Mariah Carey is One of JoJo’s Biggest Inspirations</h2><p>JoJo just released her EP, Trying Not to Think About It, and is an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">incredible songwriter</a> in her own right. Her rise to fame in 2003 at just 12 years old deserves all of the praise. JoJo’s career has taken her to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">many different places</a>, including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">singing with Carey</a> in 2020.</p><p>“Her visuals like I think of the ‘Honey’ video where she’s like taking off her little swim thing and then diving in and getting on a jet ski and she just looks so happy and free,” JoJo said. “And the way that she combined R&B and pop with hip-hop and really brought some acts that were more underground at a certain time to a very big mainstream place, I just think that’s so so dope.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Carey also rose to fame at an early age just like JoJo. Her debut album, Mariah Carey, was released in 1990. She shot to stardom after becoming notorious for her whistle tones. JoJo’s range is right up there with Carey’s as we saw on The Masked Singer. Carey’s fanbase spans several generations and JoJo is just one of the artists who have taken inspiration from the diva.</p><p>“She really is the blueprint for so many artists today and I’m just forever inspired by her and also her resilience, how people counted her out, were like ‘it’s over for you,'” JoJo said. “And then she came back with The Emancipation of Mimi and like you can never count anybody out, particularly anyone as talented as that.”</p><p>Carey replied to a clip of the interview on Twitter saying, “I love you @iamjojo!!!!” It looks like JoJo is a lamb, the name given to Carey’s fanbase.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/GettyImages-1334776601-e1633444765157.jpeg alt="‘AGT’ Aerialist Aidan Bryant Wows Ellen, Shares How Many Times He’s Fallen" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>JoJo</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>mariah carey</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqpopmYYrCivsSyZKudkZjBtHnTqGSjp5qkerG%2BwKKqoqaXYrWmvoybqaKknJ6ur8CMpqysoZNisKK%2BxJ6paA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rocnationbrunch-2015-jay-z-beyonce-kanye-kim-nas-nicki-others-looking-fabulous-in.html><span>←</span><span>Jay Z, Beyonce, Kanye, Kim, Nas, Nicki, others looking fabulous in party pictures</span></a>
