The singer’s “Queen” visuals has dropped on YouTube and he is marching to the beat of his own drum. The video comes after the entertainer faced heavy backlash for his appearance on Season 3 of “Celebrity Big Brother.”</strong></p><p>Hall isn’t letting naysayers stop his career moves. He is currently on his Femuline tour and hitting the promo circuit for his latest video. “Queen” has the usual flare that Hall has become known for. Big dance numbers, bright costumes, and cinematic backdrops as Hall embraces a Disney villainous queen character.</p><p>The Masked Singer alum says the message behind his latest single is for everyone who is extra and knows that they are different to embrace who they are. The video tells the story of Hall through birth and follows him as he goes through scenarios where the environment tries to oppress him. The singer finds himself on a journey through school, church, and finally loving who he is.</p><p>“If they ain’t mad, they ‘bout to be, my biggest video yet just released,” Hall posted on Instagram. Seemingly responding to the backlash he has received since his time on Season 3 of Celebrity Big Brother.</p><p>In another post Hall thanked his fans after many believed that his new tour would not be a success because of the competition show. According to the singer, the haters were wrong.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-queen-music-video-was-filmed-in-ukraine>The “Queen” Music Video Was Filmed in Ukraine</h2><p>Hall’s latest video was filmed in Ukraine. The singer addressed the location before the video began. Hall mentions that “Queen” was filmed before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. On Hall’s YouTube the singer encourages viewers to donate to Insight, a local LGBTQ+ organization that is currently collecting funds to cover needs in shelter, relocation to safer places, as well as food. The ongoing war in Ukraine started one month ago.</p><p>Singers such as Ed Sheeran and Camila Cabello are also assisting Ukraine. The two superstars will perform during the upcoming <a href=#>Concert for Ukraine</a>, which seeks to raise funds for the war-torn country.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/7.jpeg alt="‘The Voice Australia’s Season 11 First Look Will Melt Your Heart" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>todrick hall</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706ibq6GToHqprculZKKrXaK8t7XNoGSopl2bv7C5jJugoGWSp7y1tMSrZJuZk6C5or%2FHZq6irJhivraxxKdkr6GUmrxw</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sylvester-stallone-documentary-sly-toronto-film-festival-1235690720.html><span>←</span><span>Sylvester Stallone Documentary Sly to Close Toronto Film Festival</span></a>
