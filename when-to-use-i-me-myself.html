<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>How to use I, me or myself in English</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>English learners and native <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English</a> speakers alike have trouble knowing when to use “I”, “me” or “myself”. The rules themselves are simple: “I” is a subject pronoun, “me” is an object pronoun and “myself” is a reflexive pronoun. Use the subject pronoun “I” when the speaker is performing the action. Use the object pronoun “me” when the speaker is receiving the action. Use “myself” when the subject and object are the same.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there are some very <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">common mistakes</a> we want to help you correct and we’re going to show you some examples when to use “me”, “I” or “myself” to make sure you get this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">grammar right every time</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=The-subject-pronoun-I>The subject pronoun I</h2><p>“I” is a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">subject pronoun</a>. A subject pronoun performs the action in a sentence. This is the most important point to remember when you’re wondering whether to use “I” or “me”. Subject pronouns replace nouns in sentences. Other subject <a href=#>pronouns</a> are “you”, “he”, “she”, “it”, “we” and “they”. Note that “I” is always capitalized as a subject pronoun.</p><ul><li><strong>I</strong> would rather go home.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>I</strong> adore breezy clifftop walks in the summer.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=The-object-pronoun-me>The object pronoun me</h2><p>“Me” is an object pronoun. Like “I”, “me” refers to a first-person singular subject. However, unlike “I”, and unlike any subject pronoun, object pronouns receive the action in a sentence. Again, this is a really important thing to remember when you’re not sure if you should write “I” or “me”. Other object pronouns are “you”, “him”, “her”, “it”, “us” and “them”.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Helen gave <strong>me</strong> a ride home.&nbsp;</li><li>You told <strong>me</strong> not to tell anyone!&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Common-mistakes-with-I-and-me>Common mistakes with I and me</h2><p>You will hear lots of people, including native English speakers, making mistakes with the pronouns “I” and “me”. It usually happens when there is more than one object in a sentence. Look at this example and decide why it’s incorrect.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Peggy told Tom and I to sit down.&nbsp;<br>Try taking Tom out of the sentence:&nbsp;</li><li>Peggy told I to sit down.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Most people will be able to tell that’s an incorrect sentence. The subject pronoun “I” shouldn’t be in this sentence as it’s not performing the action, Peggy is. So, “I” should be replaced by “me”.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Peggy told Tom and <strong>me</strong> to sit down.&nbsp;<br>You might also hear people say:</li><li>Me and Tom are going to the movies later.</li></ul><p>This sentence has the opposite problem to the one above. Now the object pronoun “me” is trying to perform an action; remember, this is grammatically impossible! Try taking Tom out again.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Me is going to the movies later.&nbsp;<br>This is obviously not right. “Me” should be replaced by our action pronoun, “I”.&nbsp;</li><li>Tom and <strong>I </strong>are going to the movies later. (Correct)</li></ul><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=The-reflexive-pronoun-myself>The reflexive pronoun myself</h2><p>When the subject and the object of a verb are the same, we use a reflexive pronoun as the object. Reflexive pronouns always end in -self or -selves, and “myself” is the first-person singular reflexive pronoun. Other reflexive pronouns are “yourself”, “himself”, “herself”, “itself”, “ourselves”, “yourselves” and “themselves”. If you use “myself” in a sentence, you should have “I” as the subject pronoun. The two go together like peanut butter and jelly.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Every morning, I make <strong>myself</strong> a cup of coffee and read the news.</li><li>I cut <strong>myself</strong> shaving last night.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Common mistakes with myself</h2><p>The most common mistake people make with the reflexive pronoun “myself” is using it too much, most often in business lingo. Native speakers will very often say things like this:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Myself and Ron will be accepting proposals throughout the week.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Remember our rule about “I” and “myself” always appearing in sentences together? “I” isn’t in that sentence, so “myself” certainly shouldn’t be. Let’s take Ron out and see how the sentence looks:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Myself will be accepting proposals throughout the week.&nbsp;<br>Yes, this is wrong!</li></ul><p>The sentence should start with a subject pronoun here, doing an action. Let’s put Ron back in and correct the sentence:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Ron and<strong> I </strong>will be accepting proposals throughout the week. (Correct)</li></ul><p>Another common error is when “myself” is used as an object pronoun.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>You can call Sue or myself any time.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Let’s look at the sentence without Sue to see the mistake clearly:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>You can call myself any time.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>You can see that this should be an object pronoun, as the subject and object are not the same.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>You can call Sue or <strong>me</strong> any time. (Correct)</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Knowing when to use me, myself and I</h2><p>Now you should be confident about when to use “I” or “me” in a sentence, and when “myself” should appear. Remember, the subject pronoun “I” performs an action. The object pronoun “me” receives an action done by a different subject. And, the reflexive pronoun “myself” is only used when the subject “I” is the same as the object, “myself”. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Practice</a> using these pronouns in sentences – and be ready to correct any <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">native English speakers</a> when they make mistakes!&nbsp;</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
