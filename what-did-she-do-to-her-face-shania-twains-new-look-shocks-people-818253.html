The 58-year-old attended the 2024 MusiCares Person of&nbsp;the Year benefit gala in&nbsp;February 2024, and stunned everyone with a&nbsp;changed look.

She's still a very beautiful woman. Come here compare her makeup on these pictures and the ones above and you can almost 100% see it's a terrible makeup job.</p><p>«What did she do&nbsp;to&nbsp;her face?» was the reaction of&nbsp;an&nbsp;online user after seeing a&nbsp;red carpet photo of&nbsp;the singer at&nbsp;the event. Others followed with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>comments</a> such&nbsp;as, «Wow, that does NOT look like Shania Twain!»</p><p>However, Shania has been <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>called</a> a&nbsp;«chameleon» by&nbsp;the media before due to&nbsp;the fact that she never settles for the same look for too long. On&nbsp;March 2024, there was yet another wave of&nbsp;similar comments, triggered by&nbsp;a&nbsp;photo she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>posted</a> to&nbsp;her Instagram where she donned long pink hair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8a6/0ab/b654e95c228303ac55f00b1705.jpg><p>She looks great hair that red lipstick just doesn't do well on her with thick eyeliner...</p><p>In&nbsp;the comment section of&nbsp;the post, people claimed she was so&nbsp;far off her usual looks that she resembled other celebrities more. «This look gives me&nbsp;Kardashian vibes,» one said, while another <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, «To&nbsp;me, it’s Sofía Vergara vibe.»</p><p>Overall, people seem to&nbsp;agree that she’s hard to&nbsp;recognize in&nbsp;general. «Her new look is&nbsp;still pretty, but&nbsp;I can barely recognize her unless she starts singing. If&nbsp;I&nbsp;don’t see her name on&nbsp;it, I&nbsp;wouldn’t know it’s her,» someone <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pointed out</a>.</p><p>But there are a&nbsp;few who believe she’s looking better than ever, and expressed it&nbsp;in&nbsp;comments like «Hot as&nbsp;ever, young lady», «She looks&nbsp;25» and «You look amazingly gorgeous in&nbsp;anything.»</p><p>Shania Twain isn’t the only celebrity who has gone viral for changing their appearance. So&nbsp;did Hollywood star <a href=# title="Anne Hathaway" data-link=tag>Anne Hathaway</a>, who left fans confused after sharing photos of&nbsp;herself on&nbsp;social media.
