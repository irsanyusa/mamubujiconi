Instead, any singer that gets one chair turned for them could finish the season as the winner. Kelly Clarkson saw hoot as a winner as soon as he first took to the stage.</strong></p><p>Hoot was the last remaining country artist in The Voice season 17 finale. This singer was Kelly Clarkson’s third win since her time on the series began. Here’s everything you need to know about him, including the secret to his monumental win.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-he-was-part-of-team-kelly>1. He Was Part of Team Kelly</h2><p>Hoot first took to the stage singing “When it Rains it Pours” by Luke Combs. He joined Team Kelly after Clarkson was the only celebrity to turn their chair for him. Fans are still shocked that Blake Shelton didn’t turn his chair for this singer. He was saved by Clarkson in both the battle and knockout rounds.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/q2YZdhGDJgo</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-the-voice-fans-predicted-his-win>2. The Voice Fans Predicted His Win</h2><p>Hoot became an obvious frontrunner during The Voice live playoffs. Fans knew that he was going into the finale when his music repeatedly became the most streamed on Apple Music. His studio singles from the Top 13, 11, 10, and eight received this honor. No one was surprised to see Hoot win since a big part of winning any talent show is getting maximum people to stream your songs.</p><p>He won the series because he consistently gave great performances. Hoot clearly had a leg up on the competition in that department; he was the most-streamed artist 4 weeks in a row and his songs hit No. 1 on both the Country and All Genres charts.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B6Lc_pUHC9x/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-jake-hoot-was-the-only-country-artist-in-the-voice-finale>3. Jake Hoot Was The Only Country Artist in The Voice Finale</h2><p>The season 17 finale of The Voice was interesting in many aspects, including the fact that only one country artist remained. It also says a lot that the country artist wasn’t on Team Blake. This finale marked the first time since season 10 that each coach was represented in the finale. Going into the finale results, seven out of eight spots on the iTunes chart were occupied by The Voice Top 4. Even though the competition was pretty close, Hoot fans didn’t lose faith in the singer.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CPCFLW9Bm-o/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-he-got-remarried-in-2021>4.

The couple divorced in 2017, this singer was a single father of one while competing on The Voice. Jake and Brittney Hoot met nearly 10 years ago as wedding singers. In 2018 Hoot went on a mission trip to Nicaragua where the two reconnected.</p><p>They once again reconnected in 2020 and have been together ever since. On March 7, 2021, he married his other half, Brittney Hoot. This adorable couple is seen singing together on his social media. They recently released a song together in the beginning of February.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-his-wife-is-expecting-their-first-child>5. His Wife is Expecting Their First Child</h2><p>On March 22, Hoot’s family shared a video announcing that they’re expecting. The video features Hoot playing guitar and singing. As the lyrics go on, his daughter and wife are seen holding up the lyrics to his song. The song concludes when Hoot sings “baby hoot coming soon.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/tv/CbaIw7ruec0/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-this-the-voice-winner-has-gone-viral-multiple-times-on-tiktok>6.
