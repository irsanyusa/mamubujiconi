Well…not really. Contestant Dani Shay bore a very striking resemblance to the “Baby” singer and blew everyone’s minds.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x8xAtLWRu_E</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-agt-judges-thought-dani-shay-was-actually-justin-bieber>The ‘AGT’ Judges Thought Dani Shay Was Actually Justin Bieber</h2><p>When Shay first stepped onto the stage, Howie Mandel pointed out that they look like Justin Bieber. Dani is non-binary and uses the pronouns they/them.</p><p>“Justin Bieber looks like me,” they fired back which made everyone laugh.</p><p>The 22-year-old saw looking like the pop star as a hindrance at first because people would request them to play Bieber’s songs at their shows. But ‘AGT’ was finally the chance for Shay to set the record straight.</p><p>Shay auditioned for ‘AGT’ with a rendition of the hit song “Baby,” with a new spin on the lyrics. The song was called “What the Hell,” and told the story of what it is like to look exactly like the pop star.&nbsp;The judges applauded Shay for combining humor into their songwriting on top of having stellar vocals.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">THIS BAND COMPLETELY ROCKED THE ‘AGT’ STAGE</a></strong></p><p>In the Vegas round, Shay forgot the lines to their own song due to nerves, but the judges saw something in them and sent them on to the Quarterfinals for a second chance. Piers Morgan thought the Quarterfinals performance was off-key and Howie Mandel questioned if people at home would connect with Shay. Unfortunately, they did not receive enough votes to move on in the competition.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-shay-now>Where Is Shay Now?</h3><p>After becoming a standout performer on ‘AGT,’ Shay appeared on the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>second season</a> of the Oxygen show The Glee Project. The premise of the show was for contestants to show off their musical and acting chops each week to land a role on the hit show Glee. Shay was the third contestant eliminated from the competition in 2012, but was certainly a fan favorite.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Shay then released the music video for their song “One” in 2012 with fellow The Glee Project contestant Ali Stroker.</p><p>Dani also released a short film called Shooting Star in 2019 featuring their song of the same name.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Dani is an advocate for the LGBTQ+ community and opened up about their pronouns on Instagram.</p><p>“The terms non-binary, gender non-conforming, and even ‘forest creature’ feel best to me,” they wrote. “‘They/them’ is my general pronoun preference, but I’m okay with, and actually like, being called different things by different people in my life (they know who they are). Identity can be nuanced. I wrote the line ‘I am son; I am daughter’ in 2010 and that still rings true for me today. ⁣⁣⁣⁣”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B1UcIEAAB_N/</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>SIMON COWELL WANTS TO PUT THIS 12-YEAR-OLD ‘AGT’ DANCER IN A MUSIC VIDEO</a></strong></p><p>Since appearing on ‘AGT,’ Shay has continued to pursue an acting and singing career.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>What did you think of Shay’s ‘AGT’ audition?
