I must state that I have not received one naira from any state government so far in the name of the rescue of these co-members. No group of people or organisation aided the rescue of the prospective corps members apart from the security agencies, particularly the army and the DSS,” he added.</p><p>Ahmed further disclosed that the corps members were moved from one kidnappers’ camp to the other, hence their rescue from different locations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXyku9GpqmallaKvpr7SZq6hp12ovaa602aqnqqmnrCmediemKtlmaN6o63NnaCtq12Zsq95xp6rZqapqLBur8Srq6KemZiutbHSaKqknaajvXo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cooperation-intercommunale-partie-3-la-dgf-des-epci.html><span>←</span><span>Coopration intercommunale Partie 3 : La DGF des EPCI</span></a>
