They served in the ring during different ages and had their share of influence on boxing fans. However, after detailed research on their careers, one will find out that there is only one clear winner of the debate. Stick around to find out.</p><h2>Muhammad Ali vs Mike Tyson boxing record</h2><p class=align-left>Muhammad will go down in boxing history as one of the all-time greats. Others have matched his final record of 56 wins, 5 losses, and 37 knockouts, but the calibre of his opponents and the way he dominated in his prime put him on a par with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">boxing's greats</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/6ffae670d28b7bfc.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Funniest moments of Paris 2024 Olympics including Turkish shooter with insane aura</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Tyson defeated Michael Spinks in 91 seconds, winning the title of lineal heavyweight champion. The boxer has a career record of 50 victories (including 44 knockouts), six defeats, and two draws.</p><h2>Muhammad Ali vs Mike Tyson records</h2><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>World</a> Boxing Council's heavyweight championship was won by Tyson on November 22, 1986, when he knocked out Trevor Berbick in the second round (WBC). He won the World Boxing Association (WBA) title on March 7, 1987, by defeating James Smith.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/6ffae670d28b7bfc.jpeg><p class=align-left>On August 1, 1987, Tyson defeated Tony Tucker, and all three sanctioning bodies unanimously declared him the winner (WBC, WBA, and International Boxing Federation [IBF]).</p><p class=align-left>In spite of his boxing career's many <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">ups and downs</a>, Ali was able to claim three heavyweight titles by 1978. He had already beaten heavyweight competitors like Leon Spinks in 1978 and Sonny Liston in 1964, 1974, and 1964, respectively. Muhammad was able to set a new world record for "Most Lineal World Heavyweight Championship Wins" thanks to these victories.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/6d15c381545ef4c7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>UFC flyweight rankings: Who is the best flyweight fighter?</span></p></a><h2>Muhammad Ali vs Mike Tyson comparison</h2><p class=align-left>Fans of Muhammad have a love affair with his speed. However, Muhammad was simply too fast. Ali moved quickly. The fact that the majority of heavyweights in Tyson's time were as slow as molasses added to the legend of his speed.</p><p class=align-left>To avoid punches, he relied on his quickness and agility. So his defence was like playing Russian roulette in boxing. This game caused his face to become the landing pad for tens of thousands of precise punches. Joe Frazier defeated Muhammad within an inch <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">of his</a> life in their first fight despite Ali's quickness and speed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/dab93074580d5c41.jpeg><p class=align-left>Mike Tyson fans have a love affair with Tyson's strength and intimidating demeanour, and they believe that he would easily knock Muhammad out. Mike Tyson could make grown men scream and tremble. Many opponents were intimidated by Mike Tyson's ice-cold stare and menacing ring entrance.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/3e7e3134a1627baa.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>10 of the best World Cup goal celebrations in the history of the competition</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Those men weren't Muhammad Ali at all. Without being knocked out, Muhammad resisted the thunderous hooks and uppercuts of George Foreman, Archie Moore, Joe Frazier, and Ken Norton. Due <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">to his</a> mafia connections, Sonny Liston may have been a more intimidating boxer than Mike Tyson. Two times, Muhammad humiliated him and made fun of him.</p><h2>Muhammad Ali vs Mike Tyson net worth</h2><p class=align-left>At the time of his passing, Muhammad <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">had an</a> estimated net worth of $80 million. The American boxer was among the highest-paid athletes in the world at the height of his career.</p><p class=align-left>Mike's estimated net worth in 2022 is $10 million, according to Forbes.
