They will also be graced with the presence of multi-Grammy award-winning songwriter, producer, and artist FINNEAS.</p><p>One of the best things about American Idol is the opportunity to bring successful music artists and talented hopefuls together. FINNEAS, known as Billie Eilish’s older brother, will mentor the finalists in separate groups. The groups will then perform two of his songs, “Break My Heart Again” and<a href=#> “What They’ll Say About Us.”</a></p><p>FINNEAS will also take to the stage with Ashe to perform their song “Till Forever Falls Apart.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-idol-top-4-finalists-set-to-perform-winner-s-single>‘Idol’ Top 4 Finalists Set to Perform Winner’s Single</h3><p>As the <a href=#>Top 4</a> reach the final stretch, they are now at a crucial point to showcase their talents. The remaining finalists: Casey Bishop, Chayce Beckham, Willie Spence, and Grace Kinstler, will each perform two songs.</p><p>The first song will be inspired by personal idols, which will offer them an opportunity to showcase their strengths. Each performer will then debut a recently recorded “winner’s single.” Four-time Grammy winner Christopher “Tricky” Stewart, two-time Grammy winner Ian Fitchuk, and four-time BMI songwriter of the year Ross Copperman will all help the Top 4 on the original work, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Billboard</a>.</p><p>This is the first time in Idol&nbsp;history that the contestants recorded songs to appear on the show for immediate release. Arthur Gunn and Hunter Metts, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">eliminated last week</a>, will also release songs, although they will not perform during the episode.</p><p>If there was an episode not to miss, it is definitely this one. Voting for the finalists opens at the beginning of the episode and every vote counts. The top three finalists will be revealed at the end of the show.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/American-Idol-Grace-Kinstler-scaled-e1633961910106.jpg alt="‘American Idol’ Narrows Down to the Top 3 — Who Was Eliminated?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yJ2mpWWkpL1ugIysnK1lpKR6sbHRn6arpV2stq%2B6xKuqZquZo7StsdJmmKGdkZl6sLKMrJyaq5%2BjenKFjJ%2Bgp5mcmnw%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1551835-who-safa-siddiqui-dubai-bling-age-husband-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Safa Siddiqui from Dubai Bling?
