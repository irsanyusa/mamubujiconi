The <a href=#>American Idol</a> alum is now venturing into a new portion of his career, he’s releasing music independent from any label.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-chris-daughtry-reveals-the-hardest-part-of-losing-his-mother-and-stepdaughter>Chris Daughtry Reveals The Hardest Part of Losing His Mother and Stepdaughter</h2><p>Chris Daughtry recently sat down with fellow American Idol alum <a href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a> to discuss his ongoing tour. Within the interview, Clarkson asked him how he’s been since the loss of his mother and stepdaughter. Before commenting on the topic, the singer specified that he lost his mother to cancer one week and lost his stepdaughter to suicide exactly a week later.</p><p>Daughtry notes that he processed both losses differently, but there’s one thing that stays true between both, guilt. He’s currently going through the portion of healing where “I wish I would have…” statements come about.</p><p>“Those moments of guilt is the hardest because you can’t do anything about it and there’s always going to be reminders of what you could have done or whatever and I tend to beat myself up alot over it,” he said. “It’s been, it’s been a very healing time in our house and we’ve dealt with it in a very healthy way.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>One of the ways his family dealt with the loss of his stepdaughter was by honoring her wish for a natural burial. During the burial, his stepdaughter’s body was placed into a basket and then into the ground. Family members then got to pile dirt on top of her until she was completely buried. The singer explained that although the burial was sad, it helped everyone in his family process and heal.</p><p>Since healing from his losses, Daughtry has returned to his Dearly Beloved tour. In September 2021, the band Daughtry ventured into the next portion of their career by releasing their first independent album. This 13 track album has quickly become a fan favorite.</p><p>Daughtry is continuing their Dearly Beloved tour into the summer with numerous dates around the United States. The tour concludes on September 18 in Melbourne, Florida. <a href=#>Tickets</a> and VIP packages are available for fans.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1184780544-1.jpg alt="Heidi Klum Is Already Preparing Her Halloween Costume for This Year" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>chris daughtry</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wqGpoqtdma62s8etqbJlo5bGtHnToZxmn6WeubV5yKxkraCVYrWivsOeqq1loJa%2FtXnOn2StoJVitaaty6KloGWgp7yksdKsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1559041-alain-chabat-cote-coeur-qui-sont-les-femmes-de-sa-vie.html><span>←</span><span>Alain Chabat ct cur : qui sont les femmes de sa vie ?</span></a>
