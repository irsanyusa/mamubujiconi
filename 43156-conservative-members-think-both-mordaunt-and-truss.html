But there was also some good news beneath that headline figure for Liz Truss.
Liz Truss was tied in joint-third with Rishi Sunak in our single choice question on preferred leader, but while the former Chancellor lost his head-to-head battles against both Truss and Mordaunt (as well as Kemi Badenoch and Tom Tugendhat), Truss triumphed against all the other candidates she faced bar Mordaunt."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
