He revealed that his mom signed him up for the competition, and that he wasn’t familiar with the show before he auditioned.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-morgan-wallen-reflects-on-his-time-on-the-voice>Morgan Wallen Reflects on His Time on The Voice</h2><p>Wallen recently appeared in a video for Drury Outdoors in which he participated in a Missouri hunting trip. During the video, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">country singer reflected</a> on his history with music. He said his mom “threw me on stage” at church when he was 3 years old.</p><p>It was also his mom who made The Voice happen for him, as she signed him up to audition for the show. Wallen explained that he “didn’t even know what it was” and had “never even heard of it,” but he told his mom he would go “if you drive me to St. Louis.”</p><p>“I wanted to sing country music but they wanted me to sing pop music, so I was just like I guess these people are really smart people, I guess I’ll try it,” Wallen said of his time on the show. “And I sang some pop songs and then they finally let me pick a song, and I picked a country song and they kicked me off.”</p><p>However, Wallen still calls it “the best thing to ever happen,” adding, “I just met some people through that and ended up moving to Nashville in 2015. It’s been good to me.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘THE VOICE’ ALUM MORGAN WALLEN ANNOUNCES 2023 WORLD TOUR DATES</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-wallen-made-it-to-the-top-20-on-season-6>Wallen Made It to the Top 20 on Season 6</h2><p>Wallen auditioned for The Voice in 2014, when he was 20 years old.

The singer chose to join Usher’s team, and he moved on to the Battles.</p><p>He went on to win his first Battle with a cover of “Hey Brother” by Avicii. However, he lost his second Battle with the song “Story of My Life” by One Direction. Wallen was then stolen by Adam Levine and headed into the Playoffs.</p><p>Wallen chose to sing “Stay” by Florida Georgia Line. As he said in the aforementioned interview, he was eliminated after this performance and never made it to the live shows.
