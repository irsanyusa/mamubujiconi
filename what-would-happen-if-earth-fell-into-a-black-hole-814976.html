But what if&nbsp;<a href=# title=Earth data-link=tag>Earth</a>, our home planet, were to&nbsp;be&nbsp;caught in&nbsp;the grip of&nbsp;a&nbsp;black hole’s event horizon? Hmm.

Let’s have a&nbsp;looksee, okey dokey?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/163/ba7/08563951ac97889bf70d97f6d9.png><p>So&nbsp;a&nbsp;black hole is&nbsp;like the bully on&nbsp;the playground. You avoid them at&nbsp;all costs. It’s a&nbsp;region of&nbsp;space where <a href=# title=gravity data-link=tag>gravity</a> is&nbsp;so&nbsp;strong that nothing, not even light, can escape&nbsp;it. It’s like Houdini in&nbsp;reverse.</p><p>As&nbsp;with snowflakes, every black hole is&nbsp;unique. Each one has its own mass, spin, and charge. And they also come in&nbsp;different sizes, sort of&nbsp;like jeans! Petite, slim, regular, and husky, or&nbsp;something...Anyway, there are four sizes. The smallest black holes are the stellar-mass kind. They’re born when a&nbsp;massive star runs out of&nbsp;juice and folds in&nbsp;on&nbsp;itself. They’re like the chihuahuas of&nbsp;the black hole world&nbsp;— they may be&nbsp;tiny, but they’re feisty! They gobble up&nbsp;nearby matter like a&nbsp;hungry puppy. And even the smallest one is&nbsp;3&nbsp;times more massive than our Sun!</p><p>Next&nbsp;up, we&nbsp;have the middle children of&nbsp;this cosmic family: intermediate-mass black holes. They’re too big to&nbsp;be&nbsp;born out of&nbsp;the collapsed stars. Scientists believe that they may be&nbsp;created when several black holes merge into one. And even though they can’t dominate galaxies, at&nbsp;least they can swallow up&nbsp;some nearby stars. Goody for them, huh? But do&nbsp;you know who can dominate a&nbsp;galaxy? The enormous monsters of&nbsp;our universe: supermassive black holes. They’re the giants with masses ranging from millions to&nbsp;billions of&nbsp;times that of&nbsp;our Sun. And they play a&nbsp;crucial role in&nbsp;the growth and formation of&nbsp;their host galaxies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/68d/e7d/8fdadd5720a25ceb3453f53292.png><p>Finally, there are ultra-massive black holes. Trust&nbsp;me, you can’t even imagine the size and the mass of&nbsp;these guys. These cosmic eldritch horrors are extremely rare, but the ones we&nbsp;know can devour entire galaxies like Pac-Man! So, what happens if&nbsp;you get too close to&nbsp;a&nbsp;black hole? Or&nbsp;more like, “what would you see in&nbsp;your last moments”? Well... First, you reach an&nbsp;event horizon. It’s like a&nbsp;“point of&nbsp;no&nbsp;return,” an&nbsp;invisible boundary that marks the edge of&nbsp;a&nbsp;black hole. And here’s where things start to&nbsp;get really weird. For example, time starts to&nbsp;slow down. Not for you&nbsp;— for an&nbsp;outsider watching you from a&nbsp;safe distance. If&nbsp;you were falling into a&nbsp;black hole, you wouldn’t feel any different. But if&nbsp;you were watching someone else fall into&nbsp;it, you’d see them slow down and eventually freeze in&nbsp;time, like in&nbsp;a&nbsp;paused video.</p><p>As&nbsp;you get even closer, you would start to&nbsp;see some pretty mind-bending things. The gravity would cause the light around you to&nbsp;bend and distort, creating a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;funhouse mirror effect. You might even see a&nbsp;halo of&nbsp;light around the black hole, known as&nbsp;the photon ring, or&nbsp;jets of&nbsp;high-energy particles spewing out from the black hole’s poles. You can actually get pretty close to&nbsp;a&nbsp;black hole without feeling any major effects. It’s only when you cross the event horizon, then there’s no&nbsp;going back. Your goose is&nbsp;cooked.</p><p>After crossing this boundary, you’d be&nbsp;unable to&nbsp;see anything. For the person watching you from the outside, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;as&nbsp;if&nbsp;you had suddenly disappeared. Meanwhile, you might start feeling a&nbsp;bit stretched out, like a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;spaghetti. This is&nbsp;because the gravity is&nbsp;so&nbsp;stark that it’s pulling you in&nbsp;different directions at&nbsp;once. There’s even a&nbsp;scientific term for it&nbsp;called “spaghettification”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3ac/c81/71fda55d358f8deb625b9815b3.png><p>Now that you’re inside a&nbsp;black hole, you’re taking aim at&nbsp;the singularity. It’s a&nbsp;point of&nbsp;infinite density in&nbsp;its center, where all matter is&nbsp;crushed down to&nbsp;a&nbsp;single point. It’s like trying to&nbsp;fit an&nbsp;<a href=# title=elephant data-link=tag>elephant</a> into a&nbsp;tiny matchbox&nbsp;— everything gets squished together until it’s as&nbsp;small as&nbsp;it&nbsp;can possibly&nbsp;be. Which means it’s time to&nbsp;wave goodbye, I&nbsp;guess.</p><p>And if&nbsp;all that sounds scary, here’s another fun fact: black holes are not rare at&nbsp;all! Actually, there’s one in&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;each galaxy, including our own Milky Way. So... does it&nbsp;mean that we’ll be&nbsp;eventually sucked into&nbsp;it? And if&nbsp;so, how exactly would it&nbsp;happen? Well, let’s see... Imagine a&nbsp;black hole approaching our <a href=# title="solar system" data-link=tag>solar system</a>. At&nbsp;first, it&nbsp;appears as&nbsp;nothing more than a&nbsp;tiny speck in&nbsp;the distance. But as&nbsp;it&nbsp;gets closer and closer, its gravitational pull begins to&nbsp;wreak havoc around. Planets start to&nbsp;veer off course, asteroids are flung into oblivion, and comets are shattered into a&nbsp;million pieces.</p><p>But just like waiting for the sausage to&nbsp;be&nbsp;served in&nbsp;a&nbsp;German restaurant, the “wurst” is&nbsp;yet to&nbsp;come. Like that joke. Soon, it&nbsp;inevitably reaches the Earth. First, our planet’s <a href=# title=atmosphere data-link=tag>atmosphere</a> would be&nbsp;pulled towards the black hole, triggering a&nbsp;massive windstorm. And there’d be&nbsp;huge waves on&nbsp;the oceans, the water itself being distorted by&nbsp;gravitational forces. Imagine seeing seas and oceans get stretched out!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/21b/b40/6e85aa5284a50aab2f11efe45d.png><p>Earth’s magnetic field is&nbsp;generated by&nbsp;the motion of&nbsp;molten iron in&nbsp;the planet’s core. But now, the extreme tidal forces of&nbsp;the black hole would disrupt this motion, causing the magnetic field to&nbsp;weaken and distort. All this would cause massive earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, as&nbsp;the planet’s crust and mantle were pulled apart. All infrastructure and technology would be&nbsp;completely destroyed. Buildings, bridges, and roads would be&nbsp;torn apart.</p><p>Okay let’s hit the pause button. Pretty horrifying, isn’t it? Nah, but don’t worry! You wouldn’t even have seen all that. Because you would’ve felt the effects of&nbsp;the black hole much, MUCH earlier! Back to&nbsp;the future. We’d lose our magnetic field even before everything started to&nbsp;collapse. And this means not only that the weather and climate will become terrible... we’d also be&nbsp;exposed to&nbsp;EXTREME radiation. These gamma rays and the heat from the black hole could drastically change our planet. Say ta-ta to&nbsp;all our beautiful nature. At&nbsp;least misery loves company&nbsp;— we&nbsp;won’t be&nbsp;the only ones affected by&nbsp;a&nbsp;black hole... (which is&nbsp;probably even worse).</p><p>As&nbsp;this beast engulfed the entire solar system, it&nbsp;would consume about everything. One immediate effect would be&nbsp;the disruption of&nbsp;the orbits of&nbsp;asteroids, comets, and all the other bodies. The planets would begin to&nbsp;deform and stretch, their surfaces warping like molten metal. The Sun itself would be&nbsp;affected, its surface contorting like a&nbsp;gob of&nbsp;putty.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/0e8/7be/0999a551b793b32591875a76ce.png><p>And yeah, all this is&nbsp;scary to&nbsp;even imagine. But now, breathe and relax. Because none of&nbsp;this will ever happen. This is&nbsp;the Bright Side, remember? Your infinitesimal odds of&nbsp;winning the big lottery are even better that the Earth will ever be&nbsp;swept into a&nbsp;black hole. The nearest black hole to&nbsp;our solar system is&nbsp;called Gaia BH1. Discovered by&nbsp;scientists in&nbsp;2022, it’s found in&nbsp;our own Milky Way galaxy, about 1600 light-years away from Earth. Gaia BH1&nbsp;is about 10&nbsp;times the mass of&nbsp;our Sun, which makes it&nbsp;a&nbsp;stellar-mass black hole. It’s not very interesting on&nbsp;its own, but its discovery has supplied valuable insights into the behavior of&nbsp;these cosmic monsters. But, as&nbsp;you can see, even the closest known black hole is&nbsp;over 1,000 light-years away. They move very slowly, and they’ll never get so&nbsp;close to&nbsp;our system to&nbsp;pose some kind of&nbsp;threat.</p><p>"Hey, but didn’t you say that there’s a&nbsp;black hole in&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;the Milky Way? Doesn’t that mean it’s going to&nbsp;eventually hoover up&nbsp;our entire galaxy?"— you may ask. Maybe not in&nbsp;that voice. Well don’t worry: the correct answer is&nbsp;“no.” The one in&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;our galaxy is&nbsp;called “Sagittarius A-Star”. You may remember it&nbsp;from that viral blurry photo that circled around the internet a&nbsp;few years ago. This black hole is&nbsp;indeed very massive and has a&nbsp;strong gravitational pull, like two eighth graders in&nbsp;love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/146/9d3/b06fc75268bc82cde493d61d75.png><p>However, it’s still a&nbsp;small bean. It&nbsp;only affects objects that are close to&nbsp;it. The objects in&nbsp;the galaxy are all too big and move too fast to&nbsp;be&nbsp;pulled in&nbsp;by&nbsp;black holes. Nevertheless, they’re still fascinating objects to&nbsp;study. Scientists are still trying to&nbsp;unlock the mysteries of&nbsp;black holes. And even though they’ll never be&nbsp;dangerous to&nbsp;us, they’re still a&nbsp;huge reminder of&nbsp;the incredible power of&nbsp;our universe. Now I&nbsp;think I’ll turn my&nbsp;attention to&nbsp;the incredible power of&nbsp;chocolate...</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmrqitnJl6qa3PqZynZZmbeqat0a2fZp6Voblutc2tpmaZXZe5oq%2FKZp%2BopJVihXKAmHBtaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1464501-kim-kardashians-boyfriend-pete-davidson-spotted-hanging-with-kanye-wests-daughter-north.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian's Boyfriend Pete Davidson Spotted Hanging out With Kanye West's Daughter North</span></a>
