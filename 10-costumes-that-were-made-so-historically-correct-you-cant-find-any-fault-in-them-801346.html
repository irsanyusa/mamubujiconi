Such flicks challenge their creators because it’s expected that they will be&nbsp;historically accurate, especially when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;costumes. If&nbsp;characters’ outfits end up&nbsp;having any small mistakes on&nbsp;them, viewers won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;fully lose themselves in&nbsp;the atmosphere of&nbsp;the time, and they’ll likely leave negative feedback after watching the film.</p><p>We&nbsp;at<strong>&nbsp;Bright Side </strong>looked through movies where the costumes weren’t only spectacular but also historically accurate. Also, we&nbsp;wondered what the designers were guided by&nbsp;when they first created the costumes through sketches.</p><p><h2>Emma (2020)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/054/33e/025439553a906c692b5a4bbf9f.jpg><p>The Oscar-winning costume designer, Alexandra Byrne, carefully <a href=#>studied</a> archives, vintage patterns, and the fabrics of&nbsp;the Renaissance period to&nbsp;understand what colors, fabrics, and wardrobe items were popular in&nbsp;the 1800s.</p><p>Many people mistakenly assume that people used to&nbsp;wear gloomy and lackluster clothes during those times. But the rich fashionistas of&nbsp;that period <a href=#>did</a> their best to&nbsp;show off their good taste and status through garments. They preferred rich fabrics and bright colors. That’s why Byrne decided to&nbsp;bust this widespread stereotype and showed a&nbsp;saturated candy palette in&nbsp;her costumes, from tender pinks to&nbsp;bright ocher colors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/080/20f/a97faa5ea489550216b0dc0016.jpg><p>Byrne also found inspiration in&nbsp;museum exhibits. For example, the pale-pink spencer that Emma was <a href=#>wearing</a> was actually a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the look that Regency-era fashionistas liked. Also, in&nbsp;the 1790s, men were the only ones who’d wear this short blazer, but later it&nbsp;quickly fell on&nbsp;female shoulders too. Spencers helped girls diversify the white dresses they grew tired of&nbsp;wearing, as&nbsp;they were extremely popular in&nbsp;the first quarter of&nbsp;the nineteenth century.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ea4/25c/f4a07056feb62502005ea01e92.jpg><p>Several times, Emma and other female characters appeared wearing the then-popular <a href=#>chemisettes</a>, which were thin blouses with many frills at&nbsp;the neck. During the daytime, girls would wear them over their dresses to&nbsp;cover the naked neck and neckline zone.</p><p>This airy dress is&nbsp;another example of&nbsp;how detailed the costumes were. At&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the social events in&nbsp;the film, Emma shines in&nbsp;an&nbsp;exact copy of&nbsp;a&nbsp;bright silk dress from the 1810s. The team of&nbsp;designers did their best to&nbsp;replicate the intricate ornament that decorates the bottom and the upper parts of&nbsp;the garment.</p><p><h2>Little Women (2019)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6bb/d42/f9a6495de48bc8133987c9a80b.jpg><p>What about their UGG or Bear boots???</p><p>In&nbsp;2020, the movie won an&nbsp;Oscar for “Best Costumes.” And while Jacqueline Durran <a href=#>let</a> some historical inaccuracies slide, there were some scenes with costumes that were painfully accurate for this epoch.</p><p>For example, at&nbsp;first, it&nbsp;might seem that Meg’s bright green scarf looks inappropriate because the girl wouldn’t have been able to&nbsp;afford such expensive clothes in&nbsp;saturated colors. But, in&nbsp;fact, in&nbsp;the 1850s, they <a href=#>started to&nbsp;produce</a> synthetic dyes on&nbsp;an&nbsp;industrial scale. And colors such as&nbsp;royal blue, bright purple, and green, like what Meg is&nbsp;wearing, became available for simple people too.</p><p><h2>Titanic (1997)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4ee/63f/30bd87519583537c1fd5127d53.jpg><p>Deborah Lynn Scott was the costume designer for this popular movie and <a href=#>got</a> an&nbsp;Oscar for her perfect work. The director <a href=#>asked</a> her to&nbsp;convey the epoch accurately, and with the tiniest details, because the plot was based on&nbsp;a&nbsp;famous historical event. The costume designer studied the time and read many books about etiquette in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;understand what outfits the representatives of&nbsp;elite society would appear in&nbsp;public with.</p><p>Thus, when we&nbsp;first see Rose on&nbsp;the screen, she appears in&nbsp;an&nbsp;after-lunch striped costume, which is&nbsp;almost an&nbsp;<a href=#>exact copy</a> of&nbsp;the clothes from French <a href=# title=fashion data-link=tag>fashion</a> magazines of&nbsp;the year 1912. This type of&nbsp;outfit was the perfect choice for a&nbsp;woman who was traveling in&nbsp;the second half of&nbsp;her day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8e0/b13/0aa74b5a419b44c07e4bc08166.jpg><p>Scott <a href=#>paid</a> a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;attention to&nbsp;the characters’ underwear as&nbsp;well. It’s well-known that women were not wearing bras in&nbsp;1912, but they were expected to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;clearly defined silhouette in&nbsp;public. That’s why <a href=# title="Kate Winslet" data-link=tag>Kate Winslet</a>’s character had to&nbsp;always wear corsets.</p><p><h2>The Duchess (2008)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c84/33f/69dc295e639639cdb8247ccf9a.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2009, the British costume designer, Michael O’Connor, was deservedly awarded an&nbsp;Oscar for his work. He&nbsp;<a href=#>created</a> 30&nbsp;costumes for <a href=# title="Keira Knightley" data-link=tag>Keira Knightley</a> who played Georgiana Cavendish, the Duchess of&nbsp;Devonshire. At&nbsp;some point in&nbsp;time, this historical figure was the most fashionable in&nbsp;the circles of&nbsp;the English aristocracy.</p><p>The action of&nbsp;the movie touches on&nbsp;a&nbsp;rather vast time period, from 1714 to&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the 1800s. And the costumes in&nbsp;the flick visually reflect the evolution of&nbsp;fashion during this time. For example, the wedding dress the duchess wears was obviously inspired by&nbsp;the luxury French outfits of&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the 1770s. <a href=#>Here</a>, you can see that even the ruffles on&nbsp;the skirt match. Pay attention to&nbsp;the fact that the dresses have a&nbsp;similar panier (a&nbsp;framework made of&nbsp;whalebone that was worn underneath skirts to&nbsp;give the required silhouette and support the weight of&nbsp;the heavy clothing) as&nbsp;well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7e6/8c8/bf6a2159759d6e62a2376189c7.jpg><p>Georgiana was the first woman who <a href=#>made</a> a&nbsp;trendy accessory from an&nbsp;ostrich feather. The Duchess posed for the artist wearing a&nbsp;wide-brimmed hat with feathers. After that, this headdress became more in&nbsp;demand throughout England. Of&nbsp;course, the costume designer reflected this fact in&nbsp;Keira Knightley’s wardrobe as&nbsp;well.</p><p><h2>Mulan (2020)</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/06f/36b/c7573f5dfab9febbdefffb4f02.jpg><p>The costumes are the undeniable star of&nbsp;this film adaptation. Designer Bina Daigeler <a href=#>went</a> on&nbsp;a&nbsp;3-week tour across China where she <a href=#>immersed</a> herself in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;the country and was inspired by&nbsp;the clothes of&nbsp;the Tang Dynasty (the seventh century to&nbsp;the tenth century). At&nbsp;those times, women were wearing dresses with elongated sleeves and a&nbsp;high waist. Also, the wardrobe of&nbsp;this period was distinguished by&nbsp;the brightness of&nbsp;colors: officials would wear purple, blue, and red uniforms; while other dresses would don up&nbsp;to&nbsp;5&nbsp;colors at&nbsp;once.</p><p>The costume that Mulan is&nbsp;wearing when she visits the matchmaker is&nbsp;perhaps the most memorable in&nbsp;the film. Daigeler <a href=#>brought</a> the iconic look to&nbsp;live-action through a&nbsp;hanfu, a&nbsp;traditional Chinese dress. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;decorated with handmade embroidery, consisting of&nbsp;butterflies, magnolias, and dragons. It&nbsp;took almost 4&nbsp;weeks to&nbsp;make&nbsp;it.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you like to&nbsp;watch historical movies and series?
