You arrive at&nbsp;the house and open the fridge to&nbsp;feed them something healthy like chicken. You notice a&nbsp;bar of&nbsp;chocolate and decide to&nbsp;give it&nbsp;to&nbsp;them as&nbsp;a&nbsp;treat.</p><p>Wow! That’s a&nbsp;siren! Your friend calls you and yells at&nbsp;you. Turns out she has an&nbsp;alarm system that goes off when there’s any danger to&nbsp;her kitties. You should never ever feed them chocolate!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/af6/6b6/6a64525708a2172d7a3c848969.png><p>It&nbsp;has some toxic substance in&nbsp;it&nbsp;called <strong>theobromine</strong>. No&nbsp;worries, human metabolism naturally takes care of&nbsp;it, and that’s why you can safely eat chocolate. Lots of&nbsp;it, the more, the better. Sorry got carried away.</p><p>It&nbsp;doesn’t work this way for cats though. Another dangerous component is&nbsp;<a href=# title=caffeine data-link=tag>caffeine</a>. When they both build up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cat’s body, it&nbsp;can lead to&nbsp;really serious problems, like increased heart rate and breathing, tremors, seizures, and even liver failure and coma. All sorts of&nbsp;chocolate are dangerous to&nbsp;them: semi-sweet, milk, and even white chocolate with its low percentage of&nbsp;cocoa.</p><p>Also, there are chocolate brownies, donuts, cookies, and candies. The worst kinds are dark and baker’s quality chocolate because they have more cocoa in&nbsp;them. A&nbsp;tiny square of&nbsp;baking chocolate can do&nbsp;as&nbsp;much harm as&nbsp;twenty-three wrapped chocolate drops. Chocolate ice cream might not be&nbsp;that dangerous cocoa-wise, but it&nbsp;also has <strong>sugar </strong>and <strong>lactose </strong>from the milk, so&nbsp;it’s another no-go.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/353/7d1/5722205ac498dfea2849126714.png><p>Chocolate is&nbsp;also poisonous to&nbsp;dogs, but the hazard depends on&nbsp;their size. Owners of&nbsp;hamsters, rabbits, and birds must all exclude chocolate from their pets’ diet, too. Artificial sweetener <strong>xylitol </strong>is&nbsp;also bad for all pets with no&nbsp;exceptions.</p><p>It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;found in&nbsp;candy, sugarless gum, toothpaste, baked goods, and many diet foods. It’s most dangerous for dogs. You’d better make sure any foods containing it&nbsp;are out of&nbsp;reach.</p><p>Most cats just love tuna, and it’s fine for them to&nbsp;eat the cat food variety of&nbsp;it. Regular canned tuna for humans on&nbsp;a&nbsp;regular basis can deprive them of&nbsp;some important nutrients cats need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;healthy. Don’t leave open cans anywhere accessible for your kitty. The liver is&nbsp;safe for felines in&nbsp;small amounts, but too much of&nbsp;it&nbsp;can give them more vitamin&nbsp;A than they can handle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bc0/e4c/8341dc5d7ea7de4d0567622658.png><p>Neither cats nor dogs need onions in&nbsp;any form: powdered, raw, cooked, or&nbsp;dehydrated, in&nbsp;their diet. <a href=# title=Garlic data-link=tag>Garlic</a> is&nbsp;5&nbsp;times<strong> </strong>stronger than onions, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;must be&nbsp;excluded, as&nbsp;well. Never give your cat a&nbsp;saucer of&nbsp;milk, a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;<a href=# title=cheese data-link=tag>cheese</a>, or&nbsp;other dairy.</p><p>Most felines can’t digest lactose, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;would cause them serious stomach issues. The same is&nbsp;true for dogs. Dairy products can cause food allergies in&nbsp;them. So, instead of&nbsp;sharing your ice cream cone on&nbsp;a&nbsp;summer day, give your pup cold water to&nbsp;drink.</p><p>Grapes and raisins aren’t exactly the best treat for your pet. Even a&nbsp;small amount can make them sick. Early symptoms would be&nbsp;sluggishness in&nbsp;dogs and hyperactivity in&nbsp;cats. Caffeine in&nbsp;<a href=# title=coffee data-link=tag>coffee</a>, <a href=# title=tea data-link=tag>tea</a>, and even the beans and the grounds, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;cola and energy drinks, can be&nbsp;fatal for your fluffy family member. It&nbsp;increases heart rate and breathing, makes them restless, and gives them muscle tremors as&nbsp;early symptoms.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/19f/00d/8f48ae5f50a3c2720276026312.png><p>Fat trimmings off meat and <a href=# title=bones data-link=tag>bones</a>, both cooked and uncooked, can give your kitty or&nbsp;doggy some bad digestion issues. Bones are dangerous for both as&nbsp;they can choke on&nbsp;them. They can also become an&nbsp;obstruction in&nbsp;the digestive system, and that’s no&nbsp;good. Raw eggs and meat can be&nbsp;the reason for food poisoning cats because of&nbsp;some sneaky bacteria in&nbsp;them.</p><p>Raw egg whites also contain a&nbsp;<strong>protein </strong>that can give your kitty skin and coat problems. Raw fish is&nbsp;also bad, it&nbsp;contains an&nbsp;enzyme that destroys vitamin&nbsp;B, which is&nbsp;super important for felines. When they don’t have enough of&nbsp;it, they can have neurological problems.</p><p>Now, if&nbsp;you like to&nbsp;feed your cat <strong>dog food</strong> or&nbsp;your dog <strong>cat food</strong>, stop right there. If&nbsp;either of&nbsp;them tries a&nbsp;bite of&nbsp;other species’ food by&nbsp;accident, it&nbsp;won’t be&nbsp;that bad. On&nbsp;a&nbsp;regular basis though, cats need a&nbsp;diet that’s richer in&nbsp;<strong>proteins </strong>and certain <strong>vitamins </strong>and fatty acids. Dog food doesn’t have enough of&nbsp;these nutrients. Dogs need a&nbsp;much more balanced diet than cats and cat food is&nbsp;too high in&nbsp;fat, calories, and protein for them. It&nbsp;could lead to&nbsp;obesity and seriously upset their tummies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/afc/691/8a3c775e2e9be51fd941dc0583.png><p>Something as&nbsp;harmless and vitamin-rich as&nbsp;<a href=# title=avocado data-link=tag>avocado</a> can give your pup food allergies. The reason for it&nbsp;is&nbsp;that the <strong>leaves</strong>, <strong>seed</strong>, <strong>bark</strong>, and <strong>fruit </strong>of&nbsp;an&nbsp;avocado are all rich in&nbsp;<strong>persin</strong>. Too much of&nbsp;this fatty acid-like substance can cause less than pleasant stomach issues. Plus, the seed can become an&nbsp;obstruction in&nbsp;the stomach.</p><p>Avocados are also one of&nbsp;the most dangerous foods for rabbits and are bad for pet birds because of&nbsp;persin. Some types of&nbsp;birds are fine with&nbsp;it, and some give them heart damage. So&nbsp;it’s better not to&nbsp;play the guessing game and not give them the fruit at&nbsp;all. Persimmons, peaches, and plums are a&nbsp;no-go because they have <strong>seeds </strong>or&nbsp;<strong>pits</strong>. Peach and plum pits aren’t just a&nbsp;prospective obstruction in&nbsp;the intestines but also have <strong>cyanide </strong>in&nbsp;them. It’s poisonous for both people and dogs.</p><p>When yeast dough gets in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cat’s or&nbsp;dog’s stomach it&nbsp;does its natural thing&nbsp;— it&nbsp;rises. This can stretch the pet’s abdomen and give them pain. When you’re baking, don’t leave the dough where your pet can snack on&nbsp;it. Just six raw or&nbsp;roasted <strong>macadamia </strong>nuts can make your dog really sick. It’s even more dangerous when Spot gets chocolate with macadamia nuts. Well, that’s a&nbsp;bad twofer right there!</p><p>Even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;begs for <a href=# title=chips data-link=tag>chips</a> or&nbsp;pretzels, never give it&nbsp;to&nbsp;your pup. Too much <a href=# title=salt data-link=tag>salt</a> will make them thirsty and can also give them unpleasant stomach issues and <a href=# title=depression data-link=tag>depression</a>. For pet birds, salt is&nbsp;even more dangerous. Just one pretzel can upset the fluid balance in&nbsp;them and give them dehydration.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6f4/c1d/d0a3bc5c28a8a786d2a96c49bd.png><p>Apples, cherries, apricots, pears, and other fruits with seeds and pits are all dangerous for birds because of&nbsp;the cyanide they contain. Without seeds, they’re safe to&nbsp;eat. Rabbits are better off without them, too.</p><p>Tomatoes are perfectly safe for birds, but their stems, vines, and leaves are toxic and must be&nbsp;avoided. <strong>High-fat</strong> <strong>foods</strong>, such as&nbsp;butter, oil, fatty meats, and nuts can give birds, especially Amazon and Quaker parrots, high cholesterol and obesity. Onions and garlic in&nbsp;large amounts cause digestive problems in&nbsp;birds. Mushrooms have the same effect.</p><p>Hamsters need a&nbsp;diverse diet that must not include processed <strong>sugary foods</strong>, <strong>junk food</strong>, <strong>tomatoes</strong> because they are acidic, and <strong>bitter almonds</strong> because they’re rich in&nbsp;cyanide. Peanuts have too much fat for a&nbsp;hamster, and the salty option can make them dehydrated. They can only handle really small amounts of&nbsp;fruit, and it&nbsp;must always be&nbsp;properly washed, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;vegetables.</p><p>Fat is&nbsp;bad for your pet fish, so&nbsp;make sure there’s no&nbsp;more than&nbsp;<strong>3%</strong> of&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the food you get for&nbsp;it, and up&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>6% for carnivores</strong>. Always keep their dry food in&nbsp;a&nbsp;tightly sealed smaller container. Water ruins&nbsp;it, and when you open a&nbsp;large container a&nbsp;lot, fish food absorbs moisture from the air.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/613/bed/01e6165a619f9c22d231c85622.png><p>In&nbsp;the wild, turtles never miss a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;eat and can snack on&nbsp;almost anything. They won’t find dairy there, and they can’t break down lactose, so&nbsp;don’t feed them milk, cheese, yogurt, and other dairy products. Don’t give them too much raw meat, fish, or&nbsp;chicken as&nbsp;they’d get more protein than they need.</p><p><strong>Processed </strong>human <strong>foods </strong>such as&nbsp;sausage or&nbsp;canned foods, French fries, and ketchup are a&nbsp;terrible idea, as&nbsp;well. They have too much<strong> </strong>salt and other preservatives. Also watch out for fruits, especially if&nbsp;you have an&nbsp;aquatic turtle.</p><p>Rabbits don’t need yogurt drops, high-carb treats like muesli, bread, pasta, cookies and crackers, and cereal in&nbsp;their diet. Iceberg lettuce is&nbsp;another no-go because it&nbsp;has a&nbsp;chemical that’s dangerous for their health. Potatoes and parsnips with lots of&nbsp;starch are difficult to&nbsp;digest. Peanut butter also gives them a&nbsp;tummy ache.</p><p>Hamster food, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;dog or&nbsp;cat food, must never end up&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;rabbit’s bowl. It&nbsp;has too many of&nbsp;the wrong vitamins and minerals and not enough nutrients the rabbit needs.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYycmK2rXZa7pXnDqJ6sZZOWu7V5xJqrZpuYpLCwuMCtnGanomK8tbTEq2Sfp5%2BZwG6EkGxucnBf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./touch-your-mirror-to-know-if-someones-watching-you-813781.html><span>←</span><span>Touch Your Mirror to Know If Someones Watching You</span></a>
