<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>This Cat Doesnt Drink and Leaves No Pawprints</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Let’s get into the “purrfect” world of&nbsp;felines. From the sand <a href=# title=cat data-link=tag>cat</a> that can go&nbsp;for weeks without drinking <a href=# title=water data-link=tag>water</a> to&nbsp;the first cat that went to&nbsp;space. Here are the 10&nbsp;interesting cat facts for you to&nbsp;enjoy and be&nbsp;informed about.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e8a/c9f/dc5a7952179f8cc608dc81a310.png><p>This train station is&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Japan data-link=tag>Japan</a>. What makes it&nbsp;special is&nbsp;its employees. In&nbsp;Kishi Station, a&nbsp;cat named Tama used to&nbsp;work as&nbsp;a&nbsp;station master. The building has cat eyes and ears. Yep, they constructed the station building that way. There’s even a&nbsp;Tama-themed “Tama Train”!</p><p>If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;remember this famous cat station master forever, you can buy some souvenirs. To&nbsp;get there, you need to&nbsp;start your journey from Wakayama Station. The guidance board there has illustrations of&nbsp;Tama, and when you climb the stairs, cat paw prints accompany you! Now that’s cute!</p><p>My&nbsp;first reaction when&nbsp;I looked at&nbsp;the picture of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sand cat was, “Oh, I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;smooch this cute face and pet its fluffy paws.” Then I&nbsp;kept reading about it&nbsp;and understood that this cutey is&nbsp;a&nbsp;fierce predator capable of&nbsp;eating snakes and scorpions!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/813/b06/244a045951b7d1d0fdb3fc9921.png><p>This species is&nbsp;unique because they are the only cats living primarily in&nbsp;the desert. Sand cats mostly hunt at&nbsp;night. These <a href=# title=animals data-link=tag>animals</a> mainly eat small rodents, but they also go&nbsp;after birds, hares, and insects. They even hunt venomous vipers. Maybe that’s why our kittens at&nbsp;home also wake&nbsp;us up&nbsp;at&nbsp;3&nbsp;am and run from one room to&nbsp;another.</p><p>Moreover, they don’t need much water. They can go&nbsp;for weeks without a&nbsp;single sip. They get all the moisture they need from the prey they eat. Sand cats can live from 23&nbsp;to&nbsp;126 degrees Fahrenheit. By&nbsp;the way, they have fur under their paws, too. These are much fluffier compared to&nbsp;a&nbsp;regular cat paw.</p><p>The fur under their paws is&nbsp;not just there to&nbsp;protect the paw from the burning sand. It&nbsp;works as&nbsp;a&nbsp;cushion that allows the feline to&nbsp;walk on&nbsp;the sand without sinking into&nbsp;it. Because of&nbsp;that, they don’t leave any footprints behind. They’re kind of&nbsp;impossible to&nbsp;track for researchers. The cats are even seen closing their eyes at&nbsp;night when humans approach them. In&nbsp;that way, they eliminate reflection and blend with the sand.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8c1/b11/9f5381548c8354a42bad6ba28b.png><p>Did you know that the oldest known pet cat existed 9,500 years ago? The thing&nbsp;is, it&nbsp;was thought that Egyptians domesticated the cat, but in&nbsp;2004, archaeologists discovered a&nbsp;9,500-year-old cat’s remains in&nbsp;Cyprus. This news made me&nbsp;wonder where cats actually come from. Now you can find cats on&nbsp;every continent except Antarctica. But that wasn’t always the case. I&nbsp;mean, how did cats make it&nbsp;across oceans?</p><p>It&nbsp;all started around 10,000 years ago in&nbsp;what’s now modern-day <a href=# title=Turkey data-link=tag>Turkey</a>. DNA analysis says that this is&nbsp;where cats’ wild ancestors originated. Humans kept wild cats because they were useful for rodent control on&nbsp;farms. Agriculture started developing and advancing all over the world, and cats got involved too. As&nbsp;I&nbsp;said, they first reached Cyprus. Imagine you live there and haven’t seen a&nbsp;cat in&nbsp;your entire life, and then one day, you meet them. This is&nbsp;what happened globally.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b83/568/9fe86655ddb15bcda941150184.png><p>Over the next thousand years, cats entered Bulgaria and Romania. Then, in&nbsp;800&nbsp;BC, cats made their way to&nbsp;<a href=# title=Egypt data-link=tag>Egypt</a>. In&nbsp;Egypt, things escalated quickly. Cats became an&nbsp;object of&nbsp;worship. From there, the Egyptian cats spread to&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;the Romans and <a href=# title=Vikings data-link=tag>Vikings</a>. They were the ones who brought cats on&nbsp;their ships for pest control.</p><p>Cats became super popular and traveled the world by&nbsp;ship. They were seen in&nbsp;all of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Africa data-link=tag>Africa</a>, <a href=# title=Europe data-link=tag>Europe</a>, and <a href=# title=Asia data-link=tag>Asia</a>. Eventually, people sailed to&nbsp;the Americas, and of&nbsp;course, cats were in&nbsp;people’s hearts and still in&nbsp;their ships. Flash-forward; today, one-third of&nbsp;American homes have at&nbsp;least one cat!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a11/1fb/21decf523d98033c2f708747e9.png><p>Have you ever seen a&nbsp;cat with extra toes? These cats are called polydactyl cats. Extra toes can be&nbsp;found on&nbsp;their front paws and rarely on&nbsp;their hinds. Now that&nbsp;I mentioned that cats were companions to&nbsp;humans on&nbsp;ships, I&nbsp;can also add that polydactyl cats on&nbsp;the ships were considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;good luck charms. With the help of&nbsp;their extra toes, they were top-notch mouse hunters.</p><p>Plus, they were thought to&nbsp;climb higher and faster than regular cats. Sailors believed the cats were also able to&nbsp;maintain better balance at&nbsp;sea. There’s one polydactyl cat that’ll surprise you the most, though. This Canadian polydactyl fella named Jake has 28&nbsp;toes.&nbsp;7&nbsp;on each paw! It&nbsp;entered the Guinness World Records Book.</p><p>The name of&nbsp;this cat is&nbsp;Stubbs. He&nbsp;was the mayor of&nbsp;a&nbsp;small town in&nbsp;Alaska for 20&nbsp;years. He&nbsp;had several uncontested elections. Naturally, he&nbsp;didn’t hold any legislative power. He&nbsp;only held the right to&nbsp;get the love of&nbsp;locals and tourists.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1e2/2f1/c1fae0585f972d81c3fe8f83a1.png><p>Cat doors are a&nbsp;standard thing today, and even Newton contributed to&nbsp;their popularity. Yep, he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;cat lover too. He&nbsp;was working on&nbsp;his projects at&nbsp;the University of&nbsp;Cambridge, but he&nbsp;was constantly interrupted by&nbsp;his cats scratching at&nbsp;the door. He&nbsp;asked the carpenter to&nbsp;make 2&nbsp;holes in&nbsp;the door. One for the mother cat and one for her kittens. They say these holes can still be&nbsp;seen at&nbsp;the university today</p><p>Meet Félicette. She became the first feline to&nbsp;ever travel to&nbsp;space. The cat flew nearly 100 miles above the Earth in&nbsp;1963. There she also briefly experienced weightlessness. Scientists were trying to&nbsp;study better how lack of&nbsp;gravity would affect animals and what might happen to&nbsp;humans.</p><p>15&nbsp;minutes later, she safely returned to&nbsp;Earth by&nbsp;parachuting down in&nbsp;her little space capsule. What a&nbsp;“Catstronaut”! Many dogs, monkeys, and chimps went to&nbsp;space in&nbsp;the 1960s, so&nbsp;she didn’t become a&nbsp;celeb. Now we&nbsp;can change this by&nbsp;remembering her in&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ab1/e49/1c1b475e65b9a403bfa51c3bd4.png><p>How about the oldest cat that ever lived? It&nbsp;was 38&nbsp;years old! Creme Puff was born in&nbsp;August 1967 and lived until August 2005. What’s even more interesting is&nbsp;that his owner Jake Perry actually broke his own record since he&nbsp;had owned the world’s oldest cat before Creme Puff, too. I’m wondering what Perry was doing to&nbsp;keep his friends safe and sound for THAT long.</p><p>I&nbsp;mentioned the oldest cat, but what about extremely wealthy ones? It&nbsp;has millions of&nbsp;dollars. A&nbsp;person named Ben Rea bequeathed his $12.5-million wealth to&nbsp;his cat Blackie in&nbsp;1988. It&nbsp;was the last surviving cat of&nbsp;the 15&nbsp;cats Rea used to&nbsp;have in&nbsp;his mansion. The millionaire refused to&nbsp;leave it&nbsp;to&nbsp;his family; the majority of&nbsp;his wealth was shared between 3&nbsp;cat charities, with the instruction to&nbsp;look after his cat friend.</p><p>When I&nbsp;talked about sand cats, I&nbsp;wondered about the genetic makeup of&nbsp;our domestic and stray cats. A&nbsp;study revealed that domestic cats share 95.6% of&nbsp;their genetic makeup with tigers! When you trace the behaviors of&nbsp;prey stalking and pouncing of&nbsp;your cats, maybe you wouldn’t be&nbsp;that surprised.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/140/c33/57ea4850e6ac92daf79200c7af.png><p>It’s thought that cats go&nbsp;crazy for catnip, but half of&nbsp;the world’s felines don’t respond to&nbsp;catnip. Scientists still don’t know why some cats love this plant and others don’t seem that interested. They discovered that catnip sensitivity is&nbsp;hereditary. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;kitten has one catnip-lover parent, there’s a&nbsp;one-in-two chance that it&nbsp;will also like the aromatic herb.</p><p>Did you know that cats developed a&nbsp;special type of&nbsp;meow to&nbsp;communicate with humans? They generally use this tone to&nbsp;get their way with humans. This sound is&nbsp;“irresistible” for people because it’s a&nbsp;combination of&nbsp;purring and meowing. Interestingly, the frequency of&nbsp;this “meow” resembles the cry of&nbsp;an&nbsp;infant. That’s why our brain tries not to&nbsp;ignore&nbsp;it.</p><p>Cats probably feel like they have already conquered the whole world. Now, they can chill. Maybe that’s why they spend&nbsp;70% of&nbsp;their lives sleeping. This is&nbsp;roughly around 13–16 hours a&nbsp;day. They spend the rest of&nbsp;their time being adorable and impish.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGptdJmmpqsXZm8pr%2FNrWSdqpmjuG6tzZ1kpZ2Rq7K0ec2oZKmZp6W%2FqrrTrGRxaWRlf3N7</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./shy-14-year-old-shocks-skeptic-judges-leading-them-to-apologize-video.html><span>←</span><span>Shy 14-Year-Old Shocks Skeptic Judges Leading Them To Apologize [VIDEO]</span></a>
