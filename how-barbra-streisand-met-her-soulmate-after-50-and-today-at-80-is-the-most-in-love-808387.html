With a&nbsp;career spanning six decades, she is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the few performers who has won everything: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony (the so-called EGOT). She considers herself very fortunate not only for her awards but also because she has found true <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a>. Although she did it&nbsp;at&nbsp;an&nbsp;age regarded as&nbsp;older, her life story shows&nbsp;us that love may take time to&nbsp;arrive, but the wait is&nbsp;worth&nbsp;it.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we’ve looked back at&nbsp;Barbra Streisand’s love life and the secrets she’s shared to&nbsp;be&nbsp;happy and in&nbsp;love into her 80s.</p><p><h2>Her first marriage</h2></p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Barbra Streisand</a> was born in&nbsp;April 1942 and began her career in&nbsp;the 1960s, performing in&nbsp;nightclubs and theaters. Thanks to&nbsp;that, she appeared in&nbsp;some&nbsp;TV shows and, in&nbsp;1963, she managed to&nbsp;release an&nbsp;album nominated for a&nbsp;Grammy for album of&nbsp;the year.</p><p>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;his last Broadway performances, she met Elliot Gould when she auditioned for the play <i>I&nbsp;Can Get It&nbsp;for You Wholesale</i>. After the last audition, she was told, “Thank you.” She was very puzzled about being there and not knowing what would happen next, so&nbsp;she dictated her phone number to&nbsp;them and said, “So, will someone call&nbsp;me?” recalled Gould in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>. “I&nbsp;wrote down her number and called her.”</p><p>She invited him to&nbsp;see her perform, but he&nbsp;insisted they would be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the play together. And so&nbsp;they were. The following year, they were married.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;breakup caused by&nbsp;success</h2></p><p>Streisand and Gould <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>broke up</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;1969 and made their divorce official in&nbsp;1971. The singer’s meteoric career brought her fame and ambition, which eventually took its toll on&nbsp;her <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>. Gould <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>told</a> a&nbsp;newspaper that “it&nbsp;was hard to&nbsp;be&nbsp;married to&nbsp;someone who had married her success” and added that the couple “went as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;we&nbsp;could go&nbsp;together.” Barbra’s only son, Jason Gould, was born from that marriage.</p><p><h2>Two decades longing for love</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6d5/475/fc8d40560bb19d23adff530f7d.jpg><p>East News<span>, </span>Adam Scull/PHOTOlink/Everett Collection/East News</p><p>From that year&nbsp;on, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Barbra</a> had several relationships with various showbiz members. In&nbsp;1973, she started dating producer Jon Peters, her manager, and personal producer. Then, from 1983 to&nbsp;1987, Streisand moved in&nbsp;with Richard Baskin, owner of&nbsp;the Baskin-Robbins ice cream company. He&nbsp;wrote the lyrics to&nbsp;her song “Here We&nbsp;Are at&nbsp;Last.”</p><p>Also, between 1983 and 1989, she dated actors Richard Gere and <a href=# title="Clint Eastwood" data-link=tag>Clint Eastwood</a>. From 1989 to&nbsp;1991, she dated composer James Newton Howard. In&nbsp;the 90s, she was romantically involved with several actors and personalities, such as&nbsp;<a href=# title="Liam Neeson" data-link=tag>Liam Neeson</a>, Jon Voight, and Peter Weller. And from 1992 to&nbsp;1993, she dated Andre Agassi, despite their 28-year age difference. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that dating her was “like wearing burning lava.”</p><p><h2>“You dream a&nbsp;movie... and it&nbsp;appears.”</h2></p><p>It&nbsp;wasn’t until Barbra turned 55&nbsp;in&nbsp;1996 that she met James Brolin, a&nbsp;year older than her. They met on&nbsp;a&nbsp;blind date arranged by&nbsp;friends. She came from decades of&nbsp;flings and didn’t expect anything to&nbsp;be&nbsp;different this time. But it&nbsp;was.</p><p>Just months after they met, Barbra directed <i>The Mirror Has Two Faces</i>, which she described as&nbsp;a&nbsp;manifestation of&nbsp;her budding relationship with Brolin. “You dream the movie, and then it&nbsp;appears”; in&nbsp;the film, a&nbsp;woman marries a&nbsp;man for platonic reasons before falling in&nbsp;love. “Getting together with Brolin was like life imitating art,” she said in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;new chance at&nbsp;55</h2></p><p>Barbra and James <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a> two years later in&nbsp;1998&nbsp;at Streisand’s $100 million mansion in&nbsp;Malibu. Many people and the <a href=# title=media data-link=tag>media</a> were skeptical of&nbsp;the new couple, especially considering the singer’s romantic history. However, as&nbsp;the years went&nbsp;by, they proved that their relationship was meant to&nbsp;last.</p><p><h2>They moved away from the public eye.</h2></p><p>After getting married, Barbra and James decided to&nbsp;stay away from the media and the public eye. “We&nbsp;never dress up&nbsp;to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out anywhere, we&nbsp;don’t go&nbsp;to&nbsp;premieres. We&nbsp;never go&nbsp;anywhere where there are cameras..... We&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;bed all weekend. We&nbsp;read aloud to&nbsp;each other. We&nbsp;love to&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;nothing,” Barbra said in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>.</p><p><h2>“It’s a&nbsp;perfect situation”</h2></p><p>During an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a> in&nbsp;2021, the 80-year-old actor opened up&nbsp;about his life with the singer: “I&nbsp;like women who say they’re at&nbsp;peace, I’m a&nbsp;calming factor, and she picks me&nbsp;up&nbsp;and does things&nbsp;I wouldn’t normally&nbsp;do. It’s like a&nbsp;perfect situation, the two of&nbsp;us. For a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people, their marriages haven’t been going well for these 15&nbsp;months, we’ve literally fallen in&nbsp;love during this period of&nbsp;time, just being together every day and making it&nbsp;work.”</p><p>He&nbsp;added, “Neither of&nbsp;us has walked out the door [after] an&nbsp;argument, we’re good at&nbsp;talking things out. At&nbsp;23&nbsp;years, we’re better than we’ve ever been, I&nbsp;must say.”</p><p><h2>24&nbsp;years of&nbsp;dreams and counting</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b17/d1e/9adb6556ca8f8e3a445776a5eb.jpg><p>Now, 24&nbsp;years into their marriage, they are an&nbsp;example for many other actors in&nbsp;the industry. They are one of&nbsp;the longest-lasting and happiest marriages. Barbra enjoys spending time with her family, and on&nbsp;her social <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>media</a> she has posted pictures of&nbsp;moments she shares with her granddaughter, daughter of&nbsp;Kathryn, Josh’s daughter from his first marriage.</p><p><h2>The secret of&nbsp;a&nbsp;lasting marriage</h2></p><p>Their relationship exemplifies what love and effort can accomplish in&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple. The secret of&nbsp;their successful marriage has different stages. First, one must learn from the past, James Brolin <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a>, “This is&nbsp;my [...] third marriage. I&nbsp;chose difficult situations the first two times, but&nbsp;I think you learn with each one. I’m a&nbsp;person who believes that if&nbsp;I get it&nbsp;wrong, that’s when I&nbsp;learn, and when&nbsp;I get it&nbsp;right, I&nbsp;haven’t learned anything.”</p><p>Another <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>secret</a> is&nbsp;being together but maintaining independence: “We’ve bifurcated, and&nbsp;I love it&nbsp;that way. I&nbsp;have my&nbsp;own money, and she has her own money.” Another is&nbsp;to&nbsp;love each other but also love independence. “When she’s busy, she’s really focused, and part of&nbsp;our good relationship is&nbsp;that&nbsp;I get that,” Brolin <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “And if&nbsp;I come to&nbsp;her with something important, and she says, ’I don’t have time right now,’ she doesn’t have time, period. That’s how the mind works. You have to&nbsp;focus.”</p><p><h2>More than 80&nbsp;years full of&nbsp;work and love</h2></p><p>Today, in&nbsp;2022, Barbra is&nbsp;80&nbsp;years old, and James is&nbsp;81, but they are still just as&nbsp;active in&nbsp;their work and life as&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple. She has announced on&nbsp;her official website that she will be&nbsp;doing a&nbsp;small tour throughout the United States and is&nbsp;still promoting the album she released a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years ago.</p><p>She is&nbsp;also very focused on&nbsp;supporting organizations, besides being a&nbsp;great art curator and interior designer. James worked in&nbsp;the movie <i>Lightyear</i> and the series <i>Sweet Tooth</i>. But most importantly, they have each other and continue to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most loving marriages in&nbsp;show business and an&nbsp;excellent example for the new generations.</p><p>Have you ever met a&nbsp;couple who fell in&nbsp;love at&nbsp;an&nbsp;older age?</p><p>Preview photo credit East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4ybmKuaopZ6tMDRnqCsmZ6Zeq6x02afnqpdqLy2uMyaq55lkZvBpr6MbmdmmZ6ZerW7w5qwZpmkYoVxecisZK2glWK6sL%2FTZqCnZZykw6Z5l2lvbHBnZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1456338-alexis-maries-biography-age-height-ethnicity-sister-boyfriend.html><span>←</span><span>Alexis Maries biography: age, height, ethnicity, sister, boyfriend</span></a>
