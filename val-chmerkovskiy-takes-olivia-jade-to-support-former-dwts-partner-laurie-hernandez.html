He also shared an incredible video from the event.</p><p>“The best part was to see how happy all the little girls in the crowd were seeing their favorite gymnasts out there,” Chmerkovskiy wrote to accompany the post. “They got 30 more shows and they’re coming to a city near you!”</p><p>Hernandez also <a href=#>posted photos</a> with her former partner from the event, writing that the “best part of the LA show was seeing the big bro again.” She wished him luck this season on Dancing with the Stars.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CUSjCuGJjkT/</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>MAKS AND VAL CHMERKOVSKIY ANNOUNCE NEW TOUR AHEAD OF ‘DANCING WITH THE STARS’ PREMIERE</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-laurie-hernandez-won-season-23-of-dancing-with-the-stars>Laurie Hernandez Won Season 23 of ‘Dancing with the Stars’</h3><p>Hernandez is a gymnast who was part of the gold-medal-winning “Final Five” during the 2016 Summer Olympics, along with Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, Madison Kocian, and Aly Raisman.
