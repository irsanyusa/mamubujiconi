You know how it is in the Big Brother House, whether you like it or not. I can't explain it. It is extremely toxic. Even outside the house, you still witness the toxicity to some extent among the fans and all of that. I believe the show is designed that way."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Despite her criticisms, Beauty emphasised that she doesn't regret her participation in the show. She recently shared how she has used her disqualification as an opportunity for personal growth.</p><p>"I'm grateful for the lessons. I'm grateful that I can experience something like this at this stage of my life. I took time to reflect, watch the video, and talk to people. I got all the closure and insight I needed at that time. I stayed prayed up, and with God's help, today I'm actually very happy and ready," Beauty explained.</p><p>It's worth noting that Beauty recently faced criticism from fans after winning the <strong>African Magic Viewers' Award (AMVCA) </strong>for <a href=# id=f40c6b12-cf55-44fa-8779-7a8328ccf7fb>best dressed of the night</a>.</p><p>Some fans expressed their disagreement, feeling that other attendees were more deserving.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In response to the criticism, the reality star confidently replied, "I've won sha, go to court."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGabnZGqwbp5066irqqRYrGmv8KroJudo2Kvo7rAoqGaZZGoeqJ506ivoptdp7KiuMitsGarmKTEcICXoW2qpZY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./adhd-adulthood-mental-health-parenthood.html><span>←</span><span>ADHD in Adulthood: To Prepare for a New Baby, I Had to Prepare Myself</span></a>
