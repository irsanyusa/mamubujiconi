Gbera means move. Conductors often say it to the bus drivers while they are working. But when you are in some areas and this slang is being said with no danfo in view, you should become conscious as thieves who pick pockets use it in signaling to each other.</p><p class=align-left>You may have to hold on to your bags tightly and leave that vicinity as soon as possible.</p><p class=h3>2. Twale</p><p class=align-left>This slang is used when giving honor to someone. It is a way of showing respect to people in the street.

Ja</p><p class=align-left>When Nigerians say ‘ja’, it means to escape. They use it when relaying their experiences about a situation where they had to run for their safety.

Fall hand</p><p class=align-left>Nigerians often use this slang while speaking pidgin. It means to be disappointed.</p><p class=h3>9. Gbana</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt52ctcq6g166.jpeg><p class=align-left>&nbsp;</p><p class=align-left>Lagosians use gbana when talking about hemp.

Cowbell</p><p class=align-left>There is a brand of milk sold in Nigeria that is called cowbell; but when Nigerians talk about cowbell, they are referring to a woman’s bust.
