In response to Burgess’s comments, a representative for the Desperate Housewives star has chosen not to engage in the controversy, opting instead to “take the high road.”</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jesse-metcalfe-s-representative-calls-sharna-burgess-highly-unprofessional>Jesse Metcalfe’s Representative Calls Sharna Burgess “Highly Unprofessional”</h2><p>Burgess recently got candid about DWTS on her podcast, Old·ish, which she co-hosts with her partner Brian Austin Green, and Randy Spelling. She began by reflecting on her journey after becoming a professional dancer on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> in 2013. Soon after, her win with TV personality Bobby Bones during Season 27, was met with controversy, which took an emotional toll on her. The backlash resulted in her exclusion from the following season.</p><p>Upon returning for Season 29, Burgess found herself partnered with Jesse Metcalfe. She alluded to their working relationship without going into specifics, saying that she couldn’t be alone in a room with him after the initial weeks due to unspecified incidents. Their partnership ended early as they were eliminated in week four of the competition.</p><p>In response to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Burgess’s</a> revelations, Metcalfe’s representative was adamant that there was no story to tell and emphasized Metcalfe’s gentlemanly approach to the situation. The actor has chosen not to add fuel to the fire by responding on the matter.</p><p>Later, Metcalfe’s representative addressed the issue by saying that their client and Burgess did not get along during their partnership, nearly four years ago. The rep asserted that vague insinuations are both reckless and irrelevant and labeled Burgess as “highly unprofessional” for making public remarks merely to promote the debut episode of her podcast.</p><p>Cheryl Burke, another seasoned pro dancer from DWTS, has chimed in on the recent controversy. Burke, who is currently promoting her iHeartRadio podcast, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sex, Lies, and Spray Tans</a>, spoke to ET Canada’s Sangita Patel about the matter.</p><p>While Burke didn’t explicitly name her “least favorite” dance partner, she did give a hint, mentioning that the partner in question was male. She suggested that Burgess’s comments, which people have inferred to be about Metcalfe, were rather obvious, referencing Burgess’s previous win with Bones and suggesting that listeners “just need to Google it” for clarity.</p><p>In an intriguing twist, Burke revealed that she would be interviewing Burgess soon, alongside Green, at the iHeart Music Festival in Vegas. They will conduct the interviews separately, raising anticipation about what Burgess might reveal about her experiences on DWTS. With Burke’s insights and Burgess’s upcoming interview, the drama surrounding the show continues to unfold as the premiere of Season 32 draws closer.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Original_PatSajak_RyanSeacrest-220x147.jpg alt="Ryan Seacrest Shares Advice Pat Sajak Told Him Ahead of Hosting ‘Wheel of Fortune’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWgp7xuv8eaqaeZXZfCs7PErKpmm5yWtq6%2FjK2fmqxdqbWqv4yiqmaglad6uLvRrKtmnJGjsKZ5z5qpraaVp3qmwsSrZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./chute-de-la-construction-de-logements-au-deuxieme-trimestre-une-mauvaise-et-une-bonne-nouvelle.html><span>←</span><span>une mauvaise et une bonne nouvelle</span></a>
