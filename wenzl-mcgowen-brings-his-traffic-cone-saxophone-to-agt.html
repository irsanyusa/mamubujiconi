Instead, he’s premiering his Traffic Cone Saxophone on the national platform.</strong></p><p>Wenzl McGowen, known as Traffic Cone Sax Man on TikTok, is set to take the America’s Got Talent stage on July 19. According to his TikTok, he is the inventor of this unique act. He’s been posting short videos of him playing the traffic cone saxophone on the app since mid-February. Within each video, the musician is playing outside in a construction outfit. His videos on the video sharing platform have yet to go viral.</p><p>On Wenzl’s personal Instagram, he most posts videos of him playing the saxophone traditionally. Recently, the musician released his latest single “Traffic Dub Jam” on Apple Music, Spotify and YouTube. Since this song was released ahead of his AGT audition, people believe he will play it during his audition.</p><p>Wenzl’s traffic cone saxophone actually dates back to 2018, when the group Moon Hooch began publishing videos of him playing around this time. They went on to release an EP named Super Cone Bros in 2021, featuring saxophone based music.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-wenzl-mcgowen>Who is Wenzl McGowen?</h2><p>Wenzl is a musician based in Brooklyn, New York. While studying at The New School he met Michael Wilbur and James Muschler. Together, the three of them created the band Moon Hooch in 2010. The band got their start busking in the New York City subway and eventually began releasing albums once they gained enough of a reputation.</p><p>Moon Hooch began releasing songs to streaming in 2013. They currently have 138,814 monthly listeners on Spotify and over 80,700 subscribers on YouTube. This band is still active on YouTube to this day, but it seems like Muschler has departed from the group.</p><p>Outside of Moon Hooch, Wenzl studied philosophy and music at The New School and has spoken for TED and TEDx conferences. In 2020, he published a book called “The Sequence of Latent Truths: Exploring Mystical Experiences Without Dogma.” The E-book is currently on sale for $8.99 on <a href=#>Amazon</a>.</p><p>We can’t wait to see what the judges think of Wenzl’s unique <a href=#>America’s Got Talent</a> act on Tuesday night.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Original_SingHarlem_TraePattonNBC-1.jpg alt="Award Winning Gospel Choir, Sing Harlem to Appear on ‘AGT’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>agt</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571p6ls6RdorCou9aepWaaop67qL%2BMoaCsZaSnrqeyyJxknKeemnq0rdeop6Gnnpp6tbuMmp6tZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1602885-nasreddine-nabis-kaizer-chiefs-revamp-suffers-setback-stanley-nwabali-returns-chippa-united.html><span>←</span><span>Nasreddine Nabis Kaizer Chiefs Revamp Suffers Setback As Stanley Nwabali Returns to Chippa United</span></a>
