More than 31 million people who live in the roughly 115-mile wide path of totality, and millions more who traveled to the U.S. to see Monday’s total solar eclipse, will all be gazing at the sun wearing the same thing: solar eclipse glasses.&nbsp;
The highly-coveted item is important for eye safety, especially for those who live outside of the zone of totality and can only see a partial eclipse.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>10+ Costumes That Were Made So Historically Correct, You Cant Find Any Fault in Them</h2><time>Aug 13, 2024</time>

The history of&nbsp;cinematography contains many movies dedicated not to&nbsp;some abstract time period but to&nbsp;certain historical epochs. Such flicks challenge their creators because it’s expected that they will be&nbsp;historically accurate, especially when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;costumes. If&nbsp;characters’ outfits end up&nbsp;having any small mistakes on&nbsp;them, viewers won’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;fully lose themselves in&nbsp;the atmosphere of&nbsp;the time, and they’ll likely leave negative feedback after watching the film.
We&nbsp;at&nbsp;Bright Side looked through movies where the costumes weren’t only spectacular but also historically accurate.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>3 in 5 Adults Support Bans on Apps From Hostile Foreign Countries</h2><time>Aug 13, 2024</time>

Earlier this month, Montana became the first state in the nation to pass a total ban on Chinese-owned TikTok, a move that came as the federal government continues to pursue a similar effort and as lawmakers and intelligence officials warn of potential national security concerns from apps based in countries considered adversarial to the United States.
Amid these moves, most Americans oppose bans on social media apps at the state and federal level, but are much more likely to back restrictions on apps that are owned by entities considered hostile to the United States, according to a new Morning Consult survey.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>8 Celebrities We Didnt Know Had Royal Ancestors</h2><time>Aug 13, 2024</time>

With their good looks, sharp talent, and worldwide success, some Hollywood stars have been reigning in&nbsp;pop culture for decades. But we&nbsp;would be&nbsp;surprised to&nbsp;discover that a&nbsp;few of&nbsp;these famous celebs actually do&nbsp;have royal blood running through their veins and descend from European kings. We&nbsp;might be&nbsp;even more astonished when we&nbsp;see a&nbsp;side-by-side comparison with their ancestors and spot a&nbsp;physical resemblance.
Bright Side is&nbsp;fascinated by&nbsp;stars who are writing history, just like their ancestors did centuries before them.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/26/>← Prev Page</a>
