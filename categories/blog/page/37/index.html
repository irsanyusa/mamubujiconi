<a href=../../../../in-this-marriage-love-may-be-times-fool.html></a>
Lauren Groff’s new novel, Fates and Furies, should be read with both eagerness and caution. Sentence by sentence, this novel, like her others, is a thoroughbred. Measured by its narrative tricks, however, it is a Trojan horse. Groff’s story of a marriage in which neither partner truly understands the other uses a sophisticated technique to tell its simple story, subverting our expectations with a two-voice counterpoint as meaningful as it is dazzling.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Vipaka</h2><time>Aug 2, 2024</time>

“Go to your room!” is a command whose meaning is portentously familiar to every Yaleman. And, because the ceremony which takes place under Yale’s elms on the third Thursday in every May is always fully reported in metropolitan newspapers, any outsiders are well aware of the tense excitement, the sense of a noble and picturesque tradition that comes to Yale on Tap Day. But there was once a time when Yale’s four Senior Societies— Skull & Bones, Scroll & Key, Wolf’s Head, Elihu Club—were taken more seriously than now.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>In New Bargaining Agreement, Women's Soccer Ditches Draft</h2><time>Aug 1, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../../nwsl-women-soccer-collective-bargaining-agreement-draft.html></a>
The National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) and its players association agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in July—the terms were made public on Thursday— marking a major step forward for player empowerment, especially for female athletes. Wins for players in the U.S.-based NWSL include guaranteed contracts, no trades without a player’s consent, more charter flights, revenue sharing, and expanded parental leave and child-care benefits.&nbsp;
And while the deal represents one of the most progressive, pro-player agreements in North American sports history, one particular provision has the potential to shake up other leagues, on both the men’s and women’s sides: This new soccer CBA, for the first time, eliminates what has become a staple of American sports—but a foreign concept in most of the rest of the world.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../../categories/blog/page/36/>← Prev Page</a>
