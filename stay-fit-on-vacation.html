But when we spend time away from our homes and our routines, we risk losing our fitness momentum. I never want the results of all those days of training to disappear from my body, but if I’m not careful, they can — and it happens fast! For me, preparing for vacation is about more than just hitting the gym — I also need to think in advance about how I’ll keep up my fitness and balance healthy eating with a few deserved indulgences. Here are my tips on how to stay in shape while on vacation.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Keep it structured</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">If you’re the type of person who enjoys finding a local gym or popular studio workout, decide before you leave for your trip when and where you’ll work out. If you’re going for a class, make sure you secure your spot in advance so you don’t have to stress about getting in on the fly. This works for anyone who feels like he or she <i>needs</i> time in a gym. I am not that person. Don’t get me wrong, I love a fitness-based vacation (I just did an awesome <a href=# rel=noopener>XPT training</a> trip with <a href=# rel=noopener>Gabby Reece</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Laird Hamilton</a>). However, if I’m exploring a place like Paris, you will not find me remotely close to any gym or studio. Period. If you’re like me, I recommend…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/stacey-griffith1.jpeg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Incorporate fitness into your activities</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When I travel, I love to walk around to see the sights — and rack up steps on my fitness tracker. Walking burns calories, keeps my metabolism revved up and, when coupled with a full day of drinking water, leaves me feeling great without having to hit the studio for a class. Whenever I’m walking up stairs, I always take them two at a time to engage my glutes more and give my quads an extra little pump. (Be sure to bring sneakers on your trip — you will definitely use them!)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">You can squeeze in moments of fitness at unexpected times. Believe it or not, when I stretch in the shower for a couple extra minutes in the hot water, I get out feeling like I just did a yoga class. Try pumping out a few push-ups against the tile wall, then reaching up for a full body stretch. Or try my favorite neck stretch: Drop your chin to your chest, turn your head slowly to the right, then the left, then back to center and finally, raise your chin up even more slowly, taking a nice deep, connected inhale.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Or, if the place where I’m staying has a bathtub, I like to pick up some bath salts and stretch and soak for 30-40 minutes.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Be mindful of what you eat and how much you sleep</b></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The bottom line here is that you still have to watch what you eat on vacation. Taking time off is not a license to go crazy with unhealthy food. You can enjoy all the wonders of the local culinary culture while still pacing yourself with treats and sweets.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Last but not least, sleep! I never feel better than when I get a great night’s sleep. Let your body rest and reinvigorate to be ready for the next day’s adventure.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stacey Griffith</a> is a senior master instructor at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">SoulCycle</a> and the author of the book <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Two Turns From Zero</a>.
