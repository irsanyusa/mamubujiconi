Etruscan gold book - 2,673 years old</h3></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This is believed to be the oldest multi-page book in the world. The Etruscan gold book was discovered in 1848 in a tomb near the Croatian city of Zagreb.</p><p>The tomb, dating back to the 3rd century BCE, contained the remains of a mummified woman adorned with valuable jewellery.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-dabbf18b-9ea1-4ba6-b2a0-c3059d86cfaf data-caption="Etruscan gold book [InstaForex]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/pcWktkpTURBXy9iMjI0NTllM2YzMWY5ZWE1YjdjM2I5ODJiNDk3OTQ2Ny5qcGeRlQLNAoDNAeDCww></span><p>The book consists of a series of thin gold plates, bound together with gold rings. The plates are inscribed with Etruscan text, written in a language that remains only partially deciphered.</p><p>The script resembles Etruscan but contains unique characteristics that set it apart from other known inscriptions.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>2. Nag Hammadi library - 1,693 years old</h3></p><p>The Nag Hammadi library was uncovered in 1945 by local farmers in the vicinity of Nag Hammadi, upper Egypt. It comprises a cache of 13 leather-bound papyrus codices containing a total of 52 texts, written in the Coptic language.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-b27c6d2b-a33b-447f-91fe-219654809b65 data-caption="Nag Hammadi [Biblical Arch Society]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/N2QktkqTURBXy82ODM2Y2UzZGIxZjRiMTBkMDRjY2M2NjVlNWJhNDlkNy5qcGVnkZUCzQJYzQG6wsM></span><p>These codices contain a diverse range of writings, including gnostic gospels, apocalyptic literature, prayers, hymns, and philosophical treatises.</p><p>Among the most well-known texts in the Nag Hammadi library are several gnostic gospels, such as the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Philip, and the Gospel of Truth.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>These texts provide alternate accounts of Jesus' teachings, often focusing on inner spiritual enlightenment and the divine spark within each individual.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>3. St Cuthbert gospel - 1,315 years old</h3></p><p>The St Cuthbert gospel is a beautifully preserved manuscript, popularly referred to as the oldest intact European book.</p><p>It was discovered in 1104 within the coffin of St Cuthbert, an Anglo-Saxon saint, at the Cathedral in Durham, England.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-530ae3e0-78bb-48bd-b82d-472607bcc0c2 data-caption="St Cuthbert Gospel [British Library]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/bJFktkqTURBXy9iZGNjOTQ3ODMyMGQ4ZDYxY2RiYTc4MTg5YWY4M2EyZi5qcGVnkZUCzQJ_zQHgwsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This pocket-sized book, measuring just 4.1 by 5.8 inches, is a copy of the Gospel of John written in Latin.

Book of Kells - 1,213 years old</h3></p><p>This book is believed to have been produced around the late 8th or early 9th century, likely in monastic circles in either Ireland or Scotland. It was named after the Abbey of Kells in County Meath, Ireland, where it was kept for centuries before finding a home at the Trinity College Library in Dublin.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-97528a5d-084b-4776-8a4d-9e3944d1b706 data-caption="Book Of Kells [Facsimile Finder]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/43YktkqTURBXy9lNzBjODYzMzZjNjY0ZDk3ZGFiYmJhNWEzMzZhZGZlYS5qcGVnkZUCzQKmzQHEwsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The Book of Kells contains exquisite illuminations characterised by intricate interlacing patterns, intricate knotwork, and vibrant colors.
