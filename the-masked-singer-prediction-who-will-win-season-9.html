The competition has been narrowed down to two contestants, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Medusa</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Macaw</a>. Both of them will be unmasked, but only one can be named the winner. Who will it be?</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-masked-singer-finale-is-between-medusa-and-macaw>The Masked Singer Finale Is Between Medusa and Macaw</h2><p>Medusa and Macaw have made it all the way to the finale, where they’ll fight for the chance to be named the Season 9 winner. A preview from Wednesday’s episode shows Macaw singing “All By Myself” by Celine Dion and Medusa singing “Elastic Heart” by Sia.</p><p>Medusa made their debut in the very first episode of the season, reigning after two episodes but being dethroned by California Roll (Pentatonix). However, the panel hit the “Ding Dong, Keep It On” Bell to give Medusa another chance. They ended up winning the wildcard spot in the Quarterfinals and went on to beat California Roll in the Semifinals.</p><p>Macaw began their journey at the end of the second round of the season, dethroning the reigning champion Fairy (Holly Robinson Peete) to move on to the Quarterfinals. After that, Macaw made it through to the Semifinals and eventually to the finale.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘THE MASKED SINGER,’ ‘I CAN SEE YOUR VOICE’ RENEWED FOR ANOTHER SEASON</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-will-be-named-the-season-9-winner>Who Will Be Named the Season 9 Winner?</h2><p>Both Medusa and Macaw have incredible voices, and it wouldn’t be a surprise for either of them to win the competition. However, my prediction is that Medusa will ultimately be named the winner of Season 9.</p><p>Medusa has had a very different journey this season. We’ve actually seen them perform twice as many times as Macaw, and each performance has been even more powerful than the last. Medusa made a huge comeback thanks to the “Ding Dong, Keep It On” Bell, and I think they’ll be rewarded for their determination.</p><p>There’s still a chance that Macaw will take home the Golden Mask trophy. They’ve delivered consistent performances throughout the season, showing off a great voice. It definitely wouldn’t be a disappointment to see them win.</p><p>Who do you think will win Season 9?
