Currently 35% of Britons have a favourable view of Starmer (+3 from late February), but 53% of people have a negative view of the Labour leader (no change), giving a net favourability rating of -18 overall.</p><p data-block-key=2eh0b>Starmer’s ratings are similar to those of his party, which 38% of Britons have a favourable opinion of (-1) compared to 53% who have an unfavourable view (+3).</p><h3 data-block-key=ctiyx id=rishi-sunak-and-the-conservatives>Rishi Sunak and the Conservatives</h3><p data-block-key=7btov>After a bruising <a href=#>week of leadership speculation</a>, Rishi Sunak’s favourability ratings continue to languish. With only 21% having a positive opinion of the prime minister (-1 from the previous poll), and 71% having an unfavourable view (+2), Sunak’s net score of -50 is close to his lowest to date (-51 in January).</p><p data-block-key=6mppr>The Conservative party is similarly unpopular, with 20% having a favourable opinion (no change) but 72% having an unfavourable opinion (-2).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Favourability_tracker_Mar_20242x.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3 data-block-key=8ptfz>Nigel Farage</h3><p data-block-key=fok7s>This is our first poll to include Nigel Farage since he <a href=#>emerged from the I’m a Celebrity jungle in December</a>, and the results show that if his appearance had any impact on public perceptions of him, they have since disappeared. The 24% who have a favourable view of the Reform UK president is virtually the same as it was in December (-1), while the 64% who have an unfavourable view is unchanged.</p><p data-block-key=98tve>Notably, those who voted for the Conservatives in 2019 have a more favourable opinion of Nigel Farage than they do of Rishi Sunak. While Farage is popular among 2019 Tories – 50% have a positive opinion and 42% a negative one – Sunak is unpopular, with 40% having a favourable view of the PM but 54% an unfavourable one.</p><h3 data-block-key=3iymg id=vaughan-gething-and-mark-drakeford>Vaughan Gething and Mark Drakeford</h3><p data-block-key=9vu6k>This week saw Vaughan Gething <a href=#>become First Minister in Wales</a>, following his election to leader of Welsh Labour. Unsurprisingly for a Welsh politician, Gething is poorly known on the UK level, with fully 75% of Britons saying they don’t know how they feel about him. Currently 8% have a positive view and 17% a negative one.</p><p data-block-key=3hkbr>His predecessor Mark Drakeford is hardly well-known himself, with 56% of Britons saying they don’t have an opinion on him after more than five years in office. One in six (16%) say they have a positive view of Drakeford, compared to 28% who have a negative view.</p><h3 data-block-key=yu8j6 id=diane-abbott>Diane Abbott</h3><p data-block-key=42bvl>Diane Abbott was inadvertently at the centre of a Conservative party row this month, after news emerged that Tory donor Frank Hester <a href=#>made remarks about her that many considered to be racist</a>.</p><p data-block-key=dgmpu>One in five Britons (19%) have a favourable view of Diane Abbott, compared to 55% who have an unfavourable one. Among those who voted for Labour in 2019, when she was in shadow cabinet, 43% have a positive opinion and 32% a negative one, but among those currently intending to back the party she is divisive at 38% to 36%.</p><p data-block-key=89fia>Abbott has been under suspension from the Labour party since April 2023, <a href=#>following the backlash against a letter she penned on racism</a>. In recent days, senior Labour politician Harriet Harman has said <a href=#>it would be sad if Abbott’s career were to end outside the Labour party</a>, and Labour voters agree. Despite being divided on her personally, those who currently intend to vote Labour say that Abbott should be readmitted to the party by 48% to 18%. The wider public are divided – 31% say Abbott should be allowed to return, but 32% say she should not.</p><h3 data-block-key=n93nf id=sadiq-khan-and-susan-hall>Sadiq Khan and Susan Hall</h3><p data-block-key=bvc7>Sadiq Khan was another cause of a Conservative party row in recent weeks, <a href=#>with Lee Anderson suspended as Tory deputy chair</a> for having said the mayor was being controlled by Islamists.</p><p data-block-key=fefct>Our first survey on national attitudes towards the Mayor of London since mid-2022 shows Khan’s popularity has declined slightly: 24% have a favourable view of Khan (-3), while 56% have an unfavourable opinion (+5).</p><p data-block-key=e2svm>Our first ever survey of national attitudes towards Khan’s Conservative rival, Susan Hall, shows that she is poorly recognised in the wider country. Almost eight in ten Britons (79%) say they don’t know about Susan Hall, while 5% have a positive opinion and 16 a negative one.</p><p data-block-key=5uj2g>Even among those few 2019 Conservative voters who have heard of Hall, they are more likely to have a negative opinion of her (12%) rather than a positive one (6%).</p><h3 data-block-key=it0gw id=humza-yousaf-and-nicola-sturgeon>Humza Yousaf and Nicola Sturgeon</h3><p data-block-key=fcicj>This is also the first time we’ve asked about the national favourability of Scottish First Minister Humza Yousaf. While a majority of Britons do have a view on Yousaf, such opinion tends to be negative – 39% have a negative view compared to 15% a positive one.</p><p data-block-key=4rkbp>Polling on attitudes to predecessor Nicola Sturgeon, the first since February 2023, shows that attitudes towards her have grown substantially more negative over the last year, <a href=#>a period of time that includes her arrest as part of police investigation into the SNP’s finances</a>. More than six in ten Britons (63%) have an unfavourable opinion of Sturgeon (+12 since the prior poll) compared to only 19% with a positive view (-14).</p><h3 data-block-key=8pae8 id=boris-johnson-liz-truss-and-jeremy-corbyn>Boris Johnson, Liz Truss and Jeremy Corbyn</h3><p data-block-key=e45l9>This month’s poll also included several former party leaders.</p><p data-block-key=bne8s>Our first poll asking about Boris Johnson since June 2023 shows largely the same opinion towards him, with 24% having a positive view (+4) and 70% having a negative opinion (-2). This makes him about as unpopular as Rishi Sunak on a national level, although he is less popular among those currently intending to vote for the party, of whom 64% have a positive view of Johnson compared to 76% for Sunak.</p><p data-block-key=7s03c>Among those who voted for Boris Johnson to be prime minister in 2019, however, the former PM is more well-liked than the current one, at 50% compared to Sunak’s 40%.</p><p data-block-key=1vbof>Popular among neither group of Tory voters – or anyone else – is Liz Truss. This poll is the first time we’ve asked about the former PM since February 2023, and opinion towards her remains rock bottom: only 8% have a favourable view of her (unchanged since the last poll) while 81% have an unfavourable view (also unchanged).</p><p data-block-key=g4ig>This is actually the first time we have asked the public’s opinion of Jeremy Corbyn since April 2020, and intervening four years it has changed little. Around a quarter (24%) have a favourable view of Corbyn (+4), while 65% have an unfavourable view (no change).</p><p data-block-key=1h8fe>While Corbyn is popular among those who backed the party he led into the 2019 general election (55% favourable to 39% unfavourable), he is divisive among current Labour voters, with 47% liking him but 46% disliking him. His successor Keir Starmer is more popular among both groups.</p><p data-block-key=s4ih><a href=#><b>See the full results here</b></a></p><p data-block-key=8fbfp><i>Photo: Getty</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZG2GeYCMqaaloaSesKqtzaxkn5mmpMKzrcGio6KsqWK%2FosDIp56sZZ2Wv6S0jGtna2w%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./paetongtarn-shinawatra-thailand-prime-minister-film-industry-pedigree-1236108785.html><span>←</span><span>Paetongtarn Shinawatra, Thailands Second Woman Prime Minister, Has Film-Friendly Pedigree</span></a>
