Let’s all just refer to&nbsp;these kids as ’our kids.’ Don’t say ’my adopted child.’ No&nbsp;one calls their kid their ’IVF child’.»</p><p>Adoption is&nbsp;a&nbsp;beautiful and selfless act, yet <a href=# title=society data-link=tag>society</a> often attaches an&nbsp;unnecessary stigma to&nbsp;it&nbsp;by&nbsp;emphasizing the «adopted» label. This labeling can unintentionally reinforce the idea that there is&nbsp;a&nbsp;difference between biological and adopted children, perpetuating harmful stereotypes and creating a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;being different.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1fb/b6e/2fafac5ff9a64138b89b8d1c91.jpg><p>PacificCoastNews.com/EAST NEWS</p><p>The Oscar-winning actress maintains a&nbsp;low profile when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;her personal life, especially concerning her two children. Despite her celebrity status, Bullock is&nbsp;not active on&nbsp;social media and goes to&nbsp;great lengths to&nbsp;shield her children from the intrusive lenses of&nbsp;the paparazzi.</p><p>In&nbsp;recent years, there has been a&nbsp;growing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>movement</a> to&nbsp;promote more inclusive language surrounding adoption. Organizations and advocates have been working tirelessly to&nbsp;raise awareness and educate the public about the importance of&nbsp;using respectful and affirming language when discussing adoption.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;rare glimpse into her <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> life, Bullock <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reveals</a> the unique personalities of&nbsp;her two young ones. Louis, whom she affectionately calls «Lou,» is&nbsp;described as&nbsp;being incredibly sensitive, possessing wisdom and kindness beyond his years. From the moment she first held him, Bullock sensed a&nbsp;profound spiritual presence within Louis, a&nbsp;realization that filled her with both awe and a&nbsp;deep sense of&nbsp;responsibility.</p><p>On&nbsp;the other hand, Laila is&nbsp;portrayed as&nbsp;a&nbsp;fearless fighter, and resilient in&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;adversity. Bullock speaks with admiration about Laila’s unwavering determination to&nbsp;preserve her spirit between life’s challenges. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;this resilience, Bullock believes, that has allowed Laila to&nbsp;overcome obstacles and emerge stronger. With a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;anticipation and pride, Bullock predicts that Laila’s fearlessness and strength will lead her to&nbsp;achieve remarkable feats and instigate meaningful change in&nbsp;the world.</p><p>So&nbsp;let&nbsp;us hear her plea and embrace a&nbsp;more compassionate and inclusive approach to&nbsp;talking about <a href=#>adoption</a>. Let&nbsp;us celebrate the beauty of&nbsp;all families and honor the <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> that unites them, regardless of&nbsp;how they come together.</p><p>Preview photo credit Invision/Invision/East News<span>, </span>PacificCoastNews.com/EAST NEWS</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMCiusOrmGaapaG5sK%2FKZqelnZGZwG68xKinpZ1dqbxuv9Oop2aqlZuys77Ip55mrJ9itaa%2BjKSgnatdlsBurcOop62dlGKFcoSScXBo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./pamela-anderson-nude-playboy-issue-1201652658.html><span>←</span><span>Pamela Anderson to Cover Playboys Last Nude Issue</span></a>
