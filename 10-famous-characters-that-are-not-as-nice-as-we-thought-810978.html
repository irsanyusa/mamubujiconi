We&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;revisit some popular movies, and figure out whether our favorite characters are really as&nbsp;good as&nbsp;we&nbsp;tend to&nbsp;think they are.</p><p><h2>Jane, <i>Jane Eyre</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2d8/73d/a5ec3f58d787e154a58e4d43d5.jpg><p><i>Jane Eyre</i> is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most famous and popular love <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stories</a> in&nbsp;the world. Everyone feels pity for poor Jane and admires her proper demeanor. But she was ready to&nbsp;leave the man who loved her the most because of&nbsp;her pride. However, when she suddenly became wealthy, Jane forgot about her principles.</p><p>Her selfishness ruined her own life and the life of&nbsp;everyone around her. It&nbsp;was just a&nbsp;sheer luck that no&nbsp;one died, and the story had a&nbsp;happy ending.</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;personally went through “love&nbsp;it!” to&nbsp;“can’t stand&nbsp;it!” during my&nbsp;early twenties. Mr. Rochester is&nbsp;rich, well-mannered, worldly, and he&nbsp;has personality, “depth,” and he’s accepted and admired by&nbsp;“society.”<br>Jane Eyre is&nbsp;small, insignificant, ugly, and of&nbsp;a&nbsp;lower social status. She’s an&nbsp;outcast, who’s been looked down upon all her life. She leaves him, and when she suddenly becomes rich, she decides to&nbsp;save him. It’s an&nbsp;ego trip.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Feifei Wang&nbsp;/ Quora</a></li></ul><p><h2>Elizabeth, <i>Pirates of&nbsp;the Caribbean</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/512/d33/166500591fa39b609f893b0284.jpg><p>She’s a&nbsp;spoiled girl who grew up&nbsp;in&nbsp;prosperity and luxury. Her temper isn’t what we’d call “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>nice</a>” either. She is&nbsp;used to&nbsp;the fact that everyone fulfills each and every desire she has. Elizabeth tried to&nbsp;control Jack, Will, and the other pirates. At&nbsp;the same time, she ignored others’ advice and commands.</p><p>When someone disobeyed her, she would become tough and get what she wanted no&nbsp;matter what. Being aware of&nbsp;Jack’s feelings, she kissed him and then handcuffed him to&nbsp;the ship’s mast so&nbsp;that he&nbsp;was taken by&nbsp;the Kraken.</p><p>Miss Swann almost ruined Captain Norrington’s life, and caused a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;Will’s problems. She also left her father behind for the sake of&nbsp;adventuring. Elizabeth continuously used other people to&nbsp;get what she wanted, and never felt bad about&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>Susan, <i>Desperate Housewives</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5cd/9c4/0e741d573f868037fc265eea57.jpg><p>Many viewers don’t find Susan’s clumsiness cute. Pretending to&nbsp;be&nbsp;naïve and innocent, she always pursues her selfish goals. She even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stole</a> her friend’s husband. Of&nbsp;course, all of&nbsp;the characters in&nbsp;the series aren’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>perfect</a>, but Susan, unlike Gabrielle, for example, pretends to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;super nice person.</p><p>According to&nbsp;internet <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>users</a>, Susan is&nbsp;the most selfish character of&nbsp;the series. They can’t understand how anyone can be&nbsp;friends with her. She delegates all her problems to&nbsp;her husband, friends, and daughter. And, at&nbsp;the same time, she always complains and demands to&nbsp;be&nbsp;saved.</p><p><h2>Allison Cameron, <i>House</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/29d/e69/7b0336535185cda8bad1872cdb.jpg><p>At&nbsp;first glance, Cameron is&nbsp;perfect. She’s a&nbsp;hard-working and talented doctor, a&nbsp;loving girlfriend, and a&nbsp;good friend. However, she leaves her husband as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;he&nbsp;starts to&nbsp;have some problems. She leaves the team and returns, forcing House to&nbsp;look for a&nbsp;replacement. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sticks</a> her nose into other people’s business and gives advice no&nbsp;one asked her for.</p><ul><li>Her so-called “principles” are those of&nbsp;a&nbsp;delusional 8-year-old girl, and she is&nbsp;always mad at&nbsp;everyone else because they are real human beings. Her “holier than thou” attitude is&nbsp;incredibly annoying, starting from the very first season. She lives in&nbsp;an&nbsp;optimistic reality where nobody dies, everything is&nbsp;black and white and there are no&nbsp;gray areas, and she thinks that she can somehow fix every little thing by&nbsp;just being “nice.” She is&nbsp;by&nbsp;far the worst character I’ve ever seen, not just on&nbsp;<i>House</i>, but in&nbsp;general.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;pinelakias&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><p><h2>Gandalf, <i>The Lord of&nbsp;the Rings</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/af0/e0b/73c3f25248a70ded2a09db1e1b.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;the story, Gandalf is&nbsp;a&nbsp;wise wizard who is&nbsp;powerful enough to&nbsp;overcome any evil. But despite all of&nbsp;this, the hobbits who travel with him always get into trouble. It’s also worth mentioning that it&nbsp;was Gandalf who sent halflings on&nbsp;a&nbsp;dangerous journey twice.</p><p>At&nbsp;the same time, the wizard <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hid</a> some information from his fellow travelers. He&nbsp;also uses his power as&nbsp;it&nbsp;suits him in&nbsp;the moment: sometimes he&nbsp;helps, sometimes he&nbsp;doesn’t. And the old man seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;unhappy with everyone: Bilbo, Frodo, and Boromir.</p><p><h2>Poirot, <i>Agatha Christie’s Poirot</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/df6/fe4/4fe1ce5e7e83b83987244ce0d5.jpg><p>Hercule Poirot is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very smart, attentive, and well-mannered detective, unlike Sherlock Holmes. But some readers and viewers find him quite <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>annoying</a>.</p><p>The detective always hides his revelations until the end of&nbsp;the story, making others feel awkward next to&nbsp;him. He&nbsp;also manipulates people, teases Hastings, and is&nbsp;a&nbsp;condescending person in&nbsp;general.</p><p><h2>Winnie-the-Pooh, <i>Winnie-the-Pooh</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/34d/f2f/bb665055c196aba742f92d90f2.jpg><p>The kind and sweet Winnie-the-Pooh annoys many viewers. This bear is&nbsp;definitely not a&nbsp;perfect role <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>model</a>. His character doesn’t grow, and he&nbsp;just eats and creates problems for his friends.</p><p>He’s ready to&nbsp;do&nbsp;anything for a&nbsp;pot of&nbsp;honey, he’s a&nbsp;slave to&nbsp;his emotions, and he&nbsp;often makes the life of&nbsp;Piglet really hard. Some people even believe that Winnie-the-Pooh has a&nbsp;mental <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>illness</a>.</p><p><h2>Belle, <i>Beauty and the Beast</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cbf/3df/89c17b5aa49ed25c8b55e5c16f.jpg><p>Some people seem to&nbsp;think that Belle is&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>worst</a> Disney princess. She has no&nbsp;skills, she reads when others work, and she even teases her inventor father. In&nbsp;general, she’s lazy and depends on&nbsp;men for everything.</p><p>She doesn’t follow her own rules and doesn’t know how to&nbsp;communicate with other people. Belle doesn’t care about other people’s boundaries. This is&nbsp;proven by&nbsp;the fact that she sneaks into the forbidden wing of&nbsp;the Beast’s castle out of&nbsp;sheer curiosity, even though he&nbsp;told her not&nbsp;to.</p><p>Besides, she’s not the one to&nbsp;make sacrifices. Ariel, for example, readily sacrificed her voice for love. But Belle wasn’t ready to&nbsp;sacrifice her well-being. She moved to&nbsp;the Beast’s castle only because she had no&nbsp;other choice.</p><p><h2>Anne, <i>Anne with an&nbsp;E</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/041/303/b833845141917812c7b730c5e1.jpg><p>At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the series, Anne is&nbsp;still a&nbsp;child, but the audience <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>finds</a> this character immature even for her age. She avoids dealing with problems, speaks rudely, and doesn’t think about other people’s feelings.</p><p>It&nbsp;seems that Anne should grow up&nbsp;with age and leave these childish things behind. But in&nbsp;the last episodes of&nbsp;the series, Anne still remains similarly infantile.</p><p><h2>Assane, <i>Lupin</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1cf/6f8/8bca0751ef80e4d6fef7cbe7e1.jpg><p>The main character is&nbsp;introduced as&nbsp;a&nbsp;noble thief who masterfully commits robberies, covers his tracks, and leaves the police with nothing.</p><p>He&nbsp;also loves his son and would do&nbsp;anything for him. He&nbsp;spends a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money on&nbsp;the equipment for his criminal activities, but isn’t willing to&nbsp;pay <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>child support</a> on&nbsp;a&nbsp;regular basis.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you find any other movie or&nbsp;series characters annoying? Why?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xecWapKito2Kwqa3RmpqtnaKoerW0wK1kmqqVYruwwIyaqmammZiybq3SZq6eZaSdvLazx61kcWlgboR5ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wicked-shut-down-sag-strike-1235674571.html><span>←</span><span>Wicked Had 10 Days Left of Filming Before Strike Shut Down Production, Says Stephen Schw</span></a>
