He actually has some Nigerian genes! During an interview on Revolt TV’s “Drink Champ” he disclosed that he is biologically Nigerian. He confessed to taking an ancestry test to find out his genealogy and the result came back showing that he is 53% Nigerian. “Shout out to Nigeria, I did my 23 and me ancestry dot com and my shit came back like 53% Nigerian. Yea! Me and my mum need to have a talk, I gat to go to Nigeria…I gat to go see that place,” Wayne said. This isn’t the first time Lil’Wayne is giving Nigeria a shoutout, he made reference to Nigeria in one of his 2008 hit song ‘A Milli’ he said “ I'm a Young Money Millionaire, tougher than Nigerian hair” You also recall that in January 2020, he revealed in an interview that one place in the world he would love to visit is Nigeria, he even spoke about how lit our parties are! Well, Lil’ Wayne, Nigeria is more than ready to welcome you, just ask Cardi B!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkw6qwxKhmop%2Bkq3qttctmrpqxnpp6qr%2BMpqarnV2jtqix0aKYp2Wkna6vediorGalmZy1tXnToaCno11mfKe8xqqvqbE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1404658-annalise-bishop-biography-jamie-foxxs-daughter-html.html><span>←</span><span>Annalise Bishop's biography: what is known about Jamie Foxxs daughter?</span></a>
