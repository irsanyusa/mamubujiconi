He shocked judges with his psychic abilities when he was able to tell <a href=#>Terry Crews</a> and <a href=#>Sofia Vergara</a> where they <a href=#>put their “missing things.”</a> It’s no surprise that he made it to the live shows and will be returning to the stage next week!</strong></p><p>Peter grew up in London, but recently moved to Seattle, Washington. When he took to the AGT stage, he talked about buying his first tarot card deck at nine years-old. He was always interested in psychic powers and reading people’s minds so he decided to make a career out of it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-to-know-about-agt-psychic-peter-antoniou>What to Know About ‘AGT’ Psychic Peter Antoniou</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-his-first-live-show-performance-is-the-day-after-his-birthday>1. His First Live Show Performance is the Day After His Birthday</h2><p>Peter announced via TikTok that he would be performing on the August 17 live shows. He seemed very excited to continue on the competition and told fans he would share behind the scenes footage from the performance. He also included that this event is pretty close to a very special day for him.</p><p>“Incidentally [the live show] is the day after my birthday so if you want to give me a cool birthday present, please do tune in. And make sure you vote for me,” he said on TikTok.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>Although he’s been doing his act for years, he isn’t necessarily known for it just yet. He has just 3,571 followers on Instagram and 4,165 followers on TikTok. All of his posts are related to his psychic or comedic activities so it seems like they’re more career-based and not necessarily personal.</p><p>Even though his audition has three and a half million views on YouTube, it doesn’t reflect the followers on his personal YouTube channel. Right now, he has 846 subscribers on YouTube with 13 posts. His posts aren’t super constant, so it’s clear he’s just now getting into the YouTube scene.</p><p>If I had to guess, I’d say his follower counts will grow at least three times on Tuesday night.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-he-has-a-degree-in-music>3. He Has a Degree in Music</h2><p>In 2010, Peter graduated from The University of Sheffield and has a BMUs (Bachelors of Music). On top of studying music at the university he also was involved in improvised comedy, radio production, and radio presenting.</p><p>Even in a college interview in 2010, he was known as a psychic. In this interview he talked about how when he was six he thought it would be cool to read minds, so he started working on techniques to learn how to do it. They mention how his show is about him convincing someone something and hypnosis.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-he-was-an-improv-comedy-coach-from-2009-2012>4. He was an Improv Comedy Coach from 2009-2012</h2><p>During Peter’s college days he spent some of his time as an improv comedy coach with The University of Sheffield’s improv society. He developed curriculum for improv students, gave artistic direction for the team, and did marketing outreach for events.</p><p>During this time he also led U.K. comedy tours and was a part of the <a href=#>Edinburgh International Fringe Festival</a> over six times. During an <a href=#>interview from the festival</a> he talked about how his show is the perfect mix of improv comedy and mind reading. His goal is to read their minds and also find a way to make it funny.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-he-also-teaches-his-skills>5. He Also Teaches His Skills</h2><p>He teaches through being a keynote speaker, organizing public workshops, and other physical learning materials. They say that some of the best magicians never give away the secrets to their talents, and it seems like Peter has learned that.</p><p>His online shop currently does not offer any manuals in how to be a psychic but does sell <a href=# class=broken_link>oracle decks</a>, psychic physical tools and <a href=# class=broken_link>Zoom tarot reading sessions</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" readability=3><p>https://www.tiktok.com/@peterantoniou/video/6993166493726903558?lang=en&is_copy_url=0&is_from_webapp=v1&sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6984866750409000454</p></figure><p>Tarot is a big part of his life since he got his first deck at nine years old. A lot of his TikTok content is based off of tarot. If I’m being honest, I’m quite surprised that he doesn’t have more followers since it’s a lot of his content. Virtual tarot has been a pretty big thing on TikTok in the past year.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/thumbnail_PhotoByAmericasGotTalent-ChrisHaston_Youtube-NBCUniversalMediaVillage-_v2.jpeg alt="‘America’s Got Talent’ Trio T.3 Sings For a Cause with 1aChord" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57lGaroaGenMBuwM5moqenp2Kuo7vUrWSan6SoerG%2F2JyfoptdpbK1sdFmmKesn6O2sMGO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./whoopi-goldberg-racist-rings-of-power-house-of-the-dragon-fans-1235361828.html><span>←</span><span>Whoopi Goldberg Rails Against Racist Rings of Power and House of the Dragon Fans:</span></a>
