The women’s national soccer teams of New Zealand and England are the latest to announce the end of the use of white shorts in their official uniforms, as more female athletes around the world voice concerns over period anxiety during matches.
Team New Zealand, also known as the Ford Football Ferns, said in a statement this week that it will no longer require white shorts for its players, opting instead for a white shirt with teal-blue shorts as part of its new kit for the FIFA Women’s World Cup, which the nation is co-hosting with Australia in July and August."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
