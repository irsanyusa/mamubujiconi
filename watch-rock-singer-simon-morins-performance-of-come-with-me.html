He had the judges really intrigued by his talent and they can be seen debating whether or not to turn their chairs, which eventually all four of them did.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>10-YEAR-OLD MUSICIAN CHALLENGES DAVE GROHL TO AN EPIC DRUM BATTLE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND [VIDEO]</a></p><p>loading="lazy"</p><h2>Simon Morin Gets Judges to Turn Their Chairs</h2><p>Marc Dupre, Lara Fabian, Eric Lapointe, Alex Nevsky all turn their chairs for Morin. He ended up choosing to be on Eric Lapointe’s team and Lapointe actually named him “The future of Quebec rock.” Even though Simon got a four-chair turn during his blind audition, his time on the famous show didn’t last long. He was eliminated after just one week, but that didn’t stop Morin from pursuing his singing career. He went on to audition for ‘The Voice France’ in 2018.</p><p>When Simon decided to keep pushing and not let his elimination get him down, he completely changed his look. He grew out his hair and beard this time ,which gave him a more “Rocker” look. His audition for ‘The Voice France’ was “Skin” By Rag N Bone, where he got two chair turns. He decided to join Mika’s team instead of Pagny’s, but unfortunately didn’t make it too far in this competition either. His last performance was with “Believer” by Imagine Dragons.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>SEE ALSO: <a href=# class=broken_link>SINGER FUSES COUNTRY & ROCK IN INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE ON ‘THE VOICE FRANCE’</a></p><h2>Where is he now?</h2><p>Simon is still performing (and rocking the long hair still) with his band called Toys.
