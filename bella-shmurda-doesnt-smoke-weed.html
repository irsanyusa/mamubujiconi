I started getting scared of the future. So, four years ago, I stopped," he said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The star said he's fine with people smoking the substance around him, but would be affected if he smoked it himself. To fill that gap, Shmurda prefers to kick back with cigarettes and liquor to feel good.</p><p>Upon further probing, the 28-year-old said, in his case, smoking weed did not help him be more creative, a claim popularly made about the substance, still considered illegal in Nigeria.</p><p>"Everything I was doing with smoking weed, I was having anxiety. At a point, I can be doing music and be like stop. I would just be lost in the middle. It wasn't working anymore. It wasn't helping," he said.</p><p>In a recent documentary by <strong>WeTalk Sound</strong>, Shmurda stated that <a href=# id=38d08225-7d92-442e-8047-1dae978f8345 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>his son has inspired him</a> to be better and expressed a desire to create a lasting legacy for the boy he announced to the world in November 2023.</p><p>The music star plans to drop two projects in 2024. The first is an EP that would be followed by <a href=# id=a3c5cd05-9be7-4a4a-b92f-16423ee4bc08 data-link-role-code=open_new_tab>an album to be released in September</a> in honour of his friend, <strong>Mohbad</strong>, who died last year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGabnZyhrm6%2Fx6asq5yRYrGwsdKnq2arnaS4pnnWnpydZ5ims3ODyqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./assistantes-maternelles-335-heures-par-mois-pour-1108-euros.html><span>←</span><span>335 heures par mois pour 1.108 euros...</span></a>
