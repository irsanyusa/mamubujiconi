Some are natural performers and are unphased, while others could choke, affecting their performance. In Australia’s fourth season of&nbsp;The X Factor, we saw a little bit of both in <a href=#>Shiane Hawke</a>. The teen from Darwin came across as timid and awkward but it all went away the minute she started singing. She stunned everybody with her raw talent, even making judges feel ashamed for judging too quickly.&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>Shiane Hawke does Duffy proud with this rendition of “Mercy”</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shy-on-the-outside-wait-for-her-to-become-a-diva>Shy On The Outside… Wait For Her To Become A Diva</h2><p>Shiane Hawke was just 14-years-old at the time of her audition. Already she seemed like a shy teen contestant as we watch her video intro. She claims to be nervous but keeps a smile the whole time. As she takes the stage, judges can already appear to make early assessments of her. While the judges get familiar with a quick introduction, the conversation only seems to add to negative assumptions from the judges and audience. Despite learning of her previous singing contest experience, which includes 4 total <a href=#>“Touchdowns” from&nbsp;Australian Idol&nbsp;judge Mark Holden</a>, the judges remained apprehensive. When she shared she would be singing “Mercy” by Duffy, judge Ronan Keating was doubtful.&nbsp;</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>SIMON COWELL DOUBTS 18 YO’S SONG CHOICE — WATCH HER PROVE HIM WRONG ON ‘THE X FACTOR UK’</a></strong></p><p>The song begins for the skeptic audience and she swayed the whole crowd at the first note. It was a new person on that stage as she appears to truly get lost in the singing. Shiane was no longer her shy teen self, but now an incredible performer. Her soulful, powerful voice carries the song and her raw talent has her make it look easy. The entire auditorium is on its feet for her performance and judges couldn’t believe this girl’s skill. The song ends with a standing ovation and just as quickly, the shy Shiane returns as if she was possessed by the music.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-shy-teen-has-judges-shocked>Shy Teen Has Judges Shocked</h3><p>She gave signs of a possible disaster audition and the only disaster turned out to be how short it was. The judges were stunned by what they heard and it reads on their faces. Guy Sebastian thought it was so good he had to deliver her his own “Touchdown.” Natalie Bassingthwaighte describes Shaine as “her favorite audition so far” and apologizes for her early judgment seeing how wrong she was.&nbsp;</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>‘X FACTOR’ SINGER WHO WENT VIRAL FOR ARGUMENT WITH SIMON COWELL JOINS ONLYFANS</a></strong></p><p>She earned 4 yes votes without any doubts.
