Pro tip: Make sure to check in with your partner while playing to make sure they're feeling safe and comfortable answering the question or doing whatever the dare requires.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Not sure where to start? WH has got you covered. When asking for truths, Needle recommends focusing on asking something that would spark vulnerability in your partner (think: "What are you most afraid of?"). Then, use the dare to build excitement, make each other laugh, and try something new. These questions should challenge you both to be more open and genuine with one another (while getting a little hot and heated too!). Ahead, a list of 50 truth or dare questions to get you started.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-6>Truths:</h3></p><li>What have you always wanted to try but never have?</li><li>What is your most valued memory?</li><li>What is one question you dont want me to ask you?</li><li>Which item of clothing do you think I look sexiest in?</li><li>Where do you think our most romantic kiss took place?
