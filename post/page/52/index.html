Children are actually better at&nbsp;solving problems compared to&nbsp;adults. This is&nbsp;mostly because they’re more open-minded, which gives them the opportunity to&nbsp;learn more things. That’s why these riddles might not be&nbsp;so&nbsp;easy for grown-ups.

Many viewers say no – but often this is because of geography rather than politicsWith Israeli actions in Gaza angering many across the West in recent months, there have been calls for the country to be kicked out of this year’s Eurovision, including from two Belgian culture ministers in March.

While many say they should not, the reasons why are often geographical rather than political.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>How Christopher Nolan Found Intimacy on a Grand Scale</h2><time>Jul 12, 2024</time>
<a href=../../../christopher-nolan-oppenheimer-oscars-interview.html></a>
Directors Christopher Nolan and Alfred Hitchcock do not have a whole lot in common—very different styles, very different eras, very different tales. All the same, during the five months in early 2022 when Nolan was shooting his blockbuster Oppenheimer, he found that Hitchcock’s work bubbled to mind more than once—specifically the iconic scene in Psycho in which Anthony Perkins stabs an unsuspecting Janet Leigh as she showers.

<a href=../../../lgbtq-loneliness-resilience-holidays.html></a>
Despite the promised tidings of comfort and joy, twinkling lights, and gifts exchanged, the holiday season can be a great source of pain and loneliness for those of us in the LGBTQIA+ community.

Beautiful Zendaya recently turned 27&nbsp;and received tons of&nbsp;birthday tributes, one of&nbsp;which included a&nbsp;curious mention from her loving boyfriend, Tom Holland.
