When she had her first baby, my&nbsp;husband bought her an&nbsp;expensive gift, like $200&nbsp;or $300. But I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;problem with how much my&nbsp;husband spent on&nbsp;it.</p><p>A&nbsp;few years later, Jen and her husband started earning pretty well at&nbsp;their jobs. Then Jen announced she was pregnant again and sent my&nbsp;husband the list of&nbsp;gifts she would like to&nbsp;receive; it&nbsp;was full of&nbsp;expensive things.</p><p>I&nbsp;actually thought it&nbsp;was kind of&nbsp;weird because most of&nbsp;the items were the same as&nbsp;the ones she got for her first baby shower.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5b3/a05/36f00056d09947056d158c7377.jpg><p>So&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband decided to&nbsp;spend about $400&nbsp;on a&nbsp;gift, and&nbsp;I just told him it&nbsp;was fine with&nbsp;me. A&nbsp;few weeks later, unfortunately, Jen lost her baby. I&nbsp;don’t know the details, but she was obviously devastated, and&nbsp;I felt really bad for her.</p><p>It’s been a&nbsp;few months since everything happened and my&nbsp;husband isn’t sure how to&nbsp;handle the gift situation because it’s not something that her other child can use and trying to&nbsp;have another baby would be&nbsp;very risky for her. Asking her to&nbsp;return the present seems cruel, and it’s probably too late to&nbsp;return it&nbsp;and get a&nbsp;refund.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cbc/1db/b402885b6b8512e64546084daa.jpg><p>It&nbsp;would be&nbsp;different if&nbsp;they could have used the gift: that’s money well spent. But if&nbsp;it’s going to&nbsp;sit in&nbsp;a&nbsp;box for years, then we&nbsp;don’t think it’s right.</p><p>Would it&nbsp;be&nbsp;rude of&nbsp;us to&nbsp;ask them to&nbsp;return the present? If&nbsp;we&nbsp;can’t have our money back, we’d like to&nbsp;at&nbsp;least give it&nbsp;to&nbsp;someone who will use&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>People quickly reacted to&nbsp;her story</h2></p><p>After sharing her <a href=# title=story data-link=tag>story</a>, this user received hundreds of&nbsp;comments letting her know that maybe she was the one reacting badly to&nbsp;the situation.</p><ul><li>She’s just lost her baby and her fertility. Don’t kick someone when they’re down. When she’s ready, she will probably sell your gift and use the money for something else, hopefully, something that brings her joy.<br>You decided to&nbsp;spend a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money on&nbsp;a&nbsp;gift. Maybe give less in&nbsp;the future if&nbsp;you are going to&nbsp;feel resentful later. But do&nbsp;NOT add to&nbsp;this woman’s pain, so&nbsp;you can get your money back.
