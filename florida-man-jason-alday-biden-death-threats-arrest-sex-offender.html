Boothe outlined the alleged sequence of events in a <a href=#>criminal complaint affidavit</a> filed with the Tallahassee Division of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to the affidavit, the presidential protection agency was first alerted to Alday on June 25, when an intake coordinator at a mental health facility in Tallahassee reported that Alday had checked himself in and said: “I don’t like President Biden. I want to kill him, slit his throat.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tjamas Matthews, a senior special agent of the Secret Service’s Tallahassee office, received the report and, accompanied by local sheriff’s deputies, visited Alday on July 1 at his parents’ home, where he lives. Alday denied making the statement and was agitated by Matthews’ line of questioning, the affidavit says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On July 11, the Secret Service’s Open Source Intelligence Branch (OSB) flagged that an X account linked to Alday posted “i’ll kill joe biden today!!”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The OSB also flagged four other posts from the account, which operated under the handle Jason Alderman/@Jman86628004 and has since been suspended:</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“sources: Joe biden’s health is declining rapidly. Not doing too good at all. Should I finish him off?” reads a post from June 30.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The secret service sent a special agent n----- to my house with gadsden county officers. I’ll still slit joe biden’s throat,” a post from July 1 said, using a racial slur.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I want special agent matthews dead, too. stupid n----- has gotta go!” was posted on July 5.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And later on July 11: “Where you at special agent matthews ? come arrest me n-----!! this is Jason Alday!!”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">‘He has mental health issues’</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In an <a href=#>order of detention</a>, U.S. magistrate judge Charles A. Stampelos ordered Alday to be committed to the custody of the attorney general’s office for confinement in a corrections facility.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stampelos acknowledged defense counsel’s arguments that Alday “does not have the apparent ability to carry out any threat and he has not taken any steps to carry out his threats” and that “he was just venting on the internet because he has mental health issues.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to the court document, Alday’s mother Elizabeth said her son “has schizoaffective disorder and ADHD, and he is bipolar and on the autism spectrum.” She said he relies on her for daily medication, including a mood stabilizer, antidepressants, and anti-psychosis drugs, and that he receives state-mandated weekly therapy at home. She also said that she has never seen him with a firearm and that he cannot drive.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">‘Somewhat of a danger’</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Prosecutors argued that even the most restrictive home conditions would not be sufficient for Alday, who had, while under previous monitoring <a href=#>in 2021</a>, lost his ankle bracelet and “a battery resulted when the probation officer went to investigate.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Prosecutors also claimed that Alday has access to kitchen knives and a car at home, and that he had a history of previous run-ins with law enforcement, including pushing a deputy during one of several visits to his home.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While Alday has been adjudged as “incompetent” by a state court in September 2023 and October 2021 and has state court hearings pending for August and December this year, his federal defense counsel said she believes Alday is “competent for purposes of these proceedings and that he appears to understand what is happening.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Stampelos noted that the federal court is “not bound by what the state court does” and concluded that Alday represents “somewhat of a danger” to the community, citing that he has “demonstrated a consistent trend in the last two years of competency problems and violations.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While the court documents pertaining to Alday’s current detention did not make any references to specific prior charges or offenses, a man with the same name and age is listed on Florida’s <a href=#>sex offender and predator registry</a> over an accusation in 2006 of molesting a minor aged 12 to 15.</p><h3 class="text-[1.17rem] font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">More from TIME</h3><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZwaGBlfXKEjp%2BjqKqZma5uucCnZKOZo6S7bq3LnZiyZZKesaa6jJ2cmqyYYsGpvsSaq6xlkae%2Fpr%2FTZqqesF2ks6exzZ2cq2c%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./22750-voting-intention-conservatives-36-labour-33-24-25.html><span>←</span><span>Voting Intention: Conservatives 36%, Labour 33% (24-25 Mar)</span></a>
