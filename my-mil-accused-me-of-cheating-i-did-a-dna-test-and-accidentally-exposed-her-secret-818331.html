A&nbsp;woman got accused of&nbsp;cheating because her baby had an&nbsp;unusual eye color&nbsp;— she decided to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;DNA test to&nbsp;prove she was faithful, but what she discovered was totally unexpected.</p><h2>They discovered a&nbsp;family <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>secret</a> that had been buried in&nbsp;the past.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/817/234/d26f4d57a98b5ae888f7fc60eb.jpg><p>So, this 25-year-old woman recently had a&nbsp;baby girl, and she noticed something interesting about her daughter’s appearance. «<strong>Our daughter has green eyes, unlike everyone else in&nbsp;our families My&nbsp;MIL thinks I&nbsp;cheated</strong>,» she wrote. Her husband reassured her, saying it&nbsp;was probably just random genetic things.</p><p>This lady’s husband totally trusts her, which is&nbsp;awesome. But <strong>his mom and the rest of&nbsp;the family won’t stop going on&nbsp;about their daughter’s green eyes</strong>, suggesting she might have cheated. Even her own family is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit puzzled by&nbsp;it. She got tired of&nbsp;all the gossip and decided to&nbsp;settle it&nbsp;once and for all with a&nbsp;paternity test.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/94b/347/0da2f45286ad647307ee04c841.jpg><p>They decided to&nbsp;do&nbsp;<strong>two tests</strong>: one to&nbsp;check paternity and another to&nbsp;explore their daughter’s ancestry. The mom was curious to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;there might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;distant relative they didn’t know about who could explain their daughter’s unusual eye color.</p><p>After much insistence, the husband finally agreed to&nbsp;the tests, and it&nbsp;turns out the little one is&nbsp;indeed his daughter. But here’s the twist&nbsp;— <strong>his dad isn’t really his biological father!</strong> Now, they’re both thinking about confronting the mom about&nbsp;it, but the wife’s urging caution. She thinks they should take some time to&nbsp;process this bombshell before they make any moves.</p><p>They know they should tell the husband’s dad about the DNA test results, but they’re worried about the consequences. They’re exhausted from looking after their newborn, and this news has hit them hard. They’re scared that <strong>revealing the truth might cause a&nbsp;huge family drama and even lead to&nbsp;his parents splitting&nbsp;up</strong>. It’s a&nbsp;tough situation, and they’re both feeling guilty about how things turned out.</p><p><h2>People online were equally shocked by&nbsp;what happened.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f7e/cb9/cf6e315dfda2bfb8cf9ef1d79f.jpg><ul><li>«Another possibility is&nbsp;that the MIL and FIL did in-vitro with a&nbsp;sperm donor and never told their son. The son should have a&nbsp;DNA test as&nbsp;well. This will clear up&nbsp;any of&nbsp;the scenarios, i.e. MIL had an&nbsp;affair, son was switched at&nbsp;birth, sperm donor, etc.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shbrinnnn&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«There is&nbsp;a&nbsp;small chance the husband isn’t related to&nbsp;MIL&nbsp;either, though. As&nbsp;in, switched at&nbsp;birth or&nbsp;secretly adopted.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Gaosnl&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«I&nbsp;don’t understand why you all are so&nbsp;worked up&nbsp;about the eye color in&nbsp;a&nbsp;2-month-old. My&nbsp;son had green to&nbsp;hazel eyes until he&nbsp;was almost 2. They finished at&nbsp;about a&nbsp;hazel-leaning brown. Both my&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I have brown eyes. We&nbsp;never thought anything of&nbsp;it.<br>Like, if&nbsp;you wanted to&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;test just to&nbsp;find your genetic lines or&nbsp;whatever, that might be&nbsp;interesting. But focusing on&nbsp;your husband, cheating and this eye color is&nbsp;just beyond bizarre to&nbsp;me. Anyone who insinuated&nbsp;I might have cheated would get shut down immediately. Maybe your focus should be&nbsp;on&nbsp;laying down clear boundaries with both your families, instead of&nbsp;worrying about jumping through ridiculous hoops to&nbsp;appease them.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>KickIt77&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«Green eyes are a&nbsp;genetic mutation, they can occur randomly in&nbsp;any family even those without a&nbsp;history of&nbsp;green eyes. In&nbsp;any race. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;lucky happenstance that your child got an&nbsp;eye color gene mutation which led to&nbsp;you wanting the test.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Childhood-trauma-87&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1c2/7ca/56133e5594b69e6f0f3aa1e782.jpg><p>My daughter had bright blue eyes. When she was 5 they started to change...I took monthly pictures . 5 years ild and changing. By 7 she had, and has green eyes with a blue ring around them. I was a nurse 30 years...it's normal..pigment like on skin. FACT!! 💯</p><ul><li>«One of&nbsp;my&nbsp;friends did an&nbsp;ancestry test with her sisters, she already knew that her father was a&nbsp;different person than her sisters’. There’s a&nbsp;big age gap, her mom and her sisters’ fathers were not together, and she looks exactly like her dad.<br>One thing that surprised them was that supposedly her 2&nbsp;older sisters had different fathers as&nbsp;well. Well... turns out not so&nbsp;much. They were full sisters, not half-sisters as&nbsp;they thought, so&nbsp;at&nbsp;some point, her mother had had an&nbsp;affair.<br>I&nbsp;don’t know enough to&nbsp;say if&nbsp;she cheated on&nbsp;the first guy with the second and had his kid, then got together with him and had another, or&nbsp;if&nbsp;she had the first guy have a&nbsp;kid, broke&nbsp;up, then she cheated on&nbsp;the new guy with her old&nbsp;ex. Either way, surprise full siblings, and someone, at&nbsp;least one of&nbsp;them, always thought they had a&nbsp;different dad.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>scarletnightingale&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«Who needs to&nbsp;track down the exact person in&nbsp;the family tree that had green eyes? Three of&nbsp;my&nbsp;aunt’s 4&nbsp;kids have brown eyes and one has blue eyes. Most people would just think, „Wow, genetics are wild!“ Also, why would you get a&nbsp;paternity test if&nbsp;you know you didn’t cheat?» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>EmmalouEsq&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«Whether it&nbsp;was cheating or&nbsp;something else, the fact remains that your MIL kept this from her son for his entire life, and he’s rightfully unhappy about&nbsp;it. Still, you’re making the right call by&nbsp;telling him to&nbsp;wait, and you wouldn’t have found out, to&nbsp;begin with, if&nbsp;it&nbsp;weren’t for his family badgering you over your daughter’s eye color.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Jiang_Rui&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«It&nbsp;sounds like MIL was projecting with her passive-aggressive commentary. What did she think would happen? Of&nbsp;course, you’d want to&nbsp;prove to&nbsp;her family that you didn’t cheat.
