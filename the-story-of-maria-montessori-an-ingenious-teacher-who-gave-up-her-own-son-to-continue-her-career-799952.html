Some people are delighted with the pedagogical system she created while others don’t understand how <a href=# title=it data-link=tag>it</a>’s possible to&nbsp;trust the studies of&nbsp;the woman who gave up&nbsp;her own son to&nbsp;strangers.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> became interested in&nbsp;the destiny of&nbsp;this unusual woman so&nbsp;we&nbsp;learned the details of&nbsp;her life, which was a&nbsp;constant fight between conventions and stereotypes.</p><p><h2>The Italian woman who became a&nbsp;doctor despite being bullied by&nbsp;those around her</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/87a/25e/c010b55945917fa5ee1e06de27.jpg><p><a href=#>Maria</a>, an&nbsp;Italian girl and the daughter of&nbsp;an&nbsp;official, was growing up&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;talented kid. She was fond of&nbsp;exact science and dreamt of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;<a href=# title=doctor data-link=tag>doctor</a> or&nbsp;an&nbsp;engineer. However, her father didn’t think that his daughter would become a&nbsp;doctor. Moreover, <strong>the fact that a&nbsp;woman wanted to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;doctor seemed unlikely </strong>in&nbsp;Italian society during the late nineteenth century.</p><p>Maria was adamant and successfully passed difficult exams and even <a href=#>got accepted</a> to&nbsp;medical school. When Montessori was studying to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;doctor, <strong>her fellow students considered her presence inappropriate</strong> because she was a&nbsp;woman. Her groupmates and <a href=# title=teachers data-link=tag>teachers</a> openly displayed hostility toward her. When they were conducting practical lessons on&nbsp;autopsy, all of&nbsp;the bodies were male and naked. How was it&nbsp;possible for a&nbsp;woman to&nbsp;be&nbsp;present in&nbsp;these classes?</p><p>But despite the harsh <a href=# title=psychological data-link=tag>psychological</a> atmosphere, her success in&nbsp;her studies was noticeable and she got an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;do&nbsp;<a href=#>hospital work</a> in&nbsp;the fields she was interested&nbsp;in. In&nbsp;the last 2&nbsp;years of&nbsp;her university life, Maria was studying pediatrics and psychiatry and worked in&nbsp;emergency services as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;in&nbsp;the pediatric consulting room. She <a href=#>became</a> an&nbsp;expert in&nbsp;kids’ medicine and was one of&nbsp;the first women in&nbsp;Italy to&nbsp;receive the title of&nbsp;Doctor of&nbsp;Medicine.</p><p><h2>She started to&nbsp;save kids who were believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;hopeless.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ec/139/4a66b15f72a094f16eb5e4a081.jpg><p>Working with <a href=#>children</a> as&nbsp;a&nbsp;pediatrician and visiting asylums during her work, Maria noticed that some forms of&nbsp;mental disabilities, which at&nbsp;that time were considered hopeless, could actually be&nbsp;dealt with. This purposeful woman decided that it&nbsp;was possible to&nbsp;work with these kids and help them develop.</p><p><strong>Step-by-step, she started to&nbsp;create her own <a href=#>system</a>.</strong> When giving speeches, she would say that the issue of&nbsp;mentally disabled kids was more related to&nbsp;pedagogy than it&nbsp;was to&nbsp;medicine and that she wanted to&nbsp;work with children as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mentor, not a&nbsp;doctor.</p><p>Her work gained notoriety and the National League opened an&nbsp;Orthophrenic School&nbsp;— a&nbsp;special institute for training teachers who would be&nbsp;educating mentally-ill kids. Maria was appointed to&nbsp;deputy <a href=#>director</a>.</p><p>Maria <strong>would create her methods and materials and instantly apply them to&nbsp;kids of&nbsp;a&nbsp;model classroom</strong> in&nbsp;the same institute. This class consisted of&nbsp;children who were considered “uneducable” due to&nbsp;the specifics of&nbsp;their psyche, and mental disabilities weren’t always the reason for that. The first of&nbsp;her successes was noted by&nbsp;teachers when some kids easily passed the <a href=#>exams</a> that were made for so-called “normal children.”</p><p><h2>Kindergarten class working according to Maria Montessori's system, Germany, 1925</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e57/b8e/c3f5945b9bb1dd21aeff800d73.jpg><p><h2>The secrets of&nbsp;her personal life and parting with her son</h2></p><p>This chapter of&nbsp;Maria’s life looks quite sad compared to&nbsp;all the success she achieved during her <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a>. While working as&nbsp;a&nbsp;doctor, Maria started an&nbsp;affair with her colleague, Giuseppe Montesano, which resulted in&nbsp;her <a href=#>giving birth</a> to&nbsp;an&nbsp;extramarital son. She never married Giuseppe and wanted to&nbsp;keep their relationship and their kid a&nbsp;secret. <strong>She left her son in&nbsp;the care of&nbsp;a&nbsp;wet nurse&nbsp;— not because she didn’t love him,</strong> but because he&nbsp;was born out of&nbsp;wedlock, which meant her social status would change to&nbsp;that of&nbsp;a&nbsp;single mother. This status would not allow her to&nbsp;build the career she was striving for. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;“shameful time” in&nbsp;the life of&nbsp;a&nbsp;decent woman. Once her son grew&nbsp;up, Maria finally reunited with him.</p><p><strong>Mario forgave his mother.</strong> Moreover, he&nbsp;supported all of&nbsp;her ideas and worked as&nbsp;her <a href=#>assistant</a>. Later he&nbsp;continued her work and avidly stood up&nbsp;for the principles of&nbsp;Maria’s methods for the rest of&nbsp;his life.</p><p><h2>Maria Montessori and Mario Montessori with their friends in India</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/56a/89a/fa0f2a5b3aaaae1d8937e15092.png><p><h2>How her way to&nbsp;world fame started.</h2></p><p>Maria continued her education, stood up&nbsp;for women’s and children’s rights, and worked on&nbsp;developing her own methods. She realized that these principles could be&nbsp;applied to&nbsp;the upbringing of&nbsp;healthy kids as&nbsp;well, but she couldn’t do&nbsp;it&nbsp;until the moment <strong>she was offered to&nbsp;work with kids in&nbsp;poor areas</strong>. This proposal initiated the <a href=#>start</a> of&nbsp;“Children’s Houses” that worked as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;special system and gradually started to&nbsp;appear all over Italy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/99f/0f6/e838ac5e0fab9889deb4db2c96.jpg><p>As&nbsp;her authority grew, she started to&nbsp;go&nbsp;abroad, and eventually, the once quiet student from medical school started to&nbsp;be&nbsp;recognized by&nbsp;the political leaders of&nbsp;different countries. And, her schools were opening all around the world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9cb/ff8/4d56945ded82fc5dc8373b1dd6.jpg><p>So&nbsp;what are the <a href=#>main principles</a> of&nbsp;the system that people from around the world like so&nbsp;much? They are actually quite simple: <strong>a&nbsp;child should have a&nbsp;<a href=#>choice</a> of&nbsp;what they want to&nbsp;do. They need to&nbsp;learn independence and responsibility</strong>. But they should search for the answers to&nbsp;their questions inside themselves and learn to&nbsp;feel their needs and inclinations. An&nbsp;adult can help them but should in&nbsp;no&nbsp;way direct or&nbsp;press them.</p><p>There were <a href=#>hard times</a> too. During WWII, Maria was in&nbsp;British India together with her son. However, they got in&nbsp;trouble with the British as&nbsp;Italian citizens, causing Mario to&nbsp;be&nbsp;interned for 2&nbsp;months while Maria was confined to&nbsp;the Theosophical Society compound. There, she found a&nbsp;new wave of&nbsp;inspiration for developing her system.</p><p>When she returned to&nbsp;Europe after the war, she decided to&nbsp;settle in&nbsp;the Netherlands for the rest of&nbsp;her life. But that doesn’t mean she stopped: in&nbsp;her last 6&nbsp;years, she opened schools in&nbsp;Europe and Asia, gave plenty of&nbsp;lectures and courses, helped with the development of&nbsp;UNESCO, and received many prizes and awards. She was even a&nbsp;Nobel Peace Prize nominee in&nbsp;1949, 1950, and 1951.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7dd/123/db24635d80a8d8043589939bb7.jpg><p>Montessori has many followers and people who are interested in&nbsp;her system today, and the ambiguity of&nbsp;her personality only ignites a&nbsp;bigger interest.</p><p>We&nbsp;were impressed by&nbsp;the story of&nbsp;this strong woman.
