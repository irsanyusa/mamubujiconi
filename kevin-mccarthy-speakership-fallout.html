How McCarthy’s standing could weigh on his speakership The Jan. 5-8 survey, conducted as the House narrowly elected McCarthy speaker after days of a messy and highly public airing of grievances by conservative detractors, shows Washington’s top Republican is a fairly divisive figure among the party’s base, though he is more popular than the other chamber’s leading Republican, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky."><meta name=author content="Reinaldo Massengill"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Wade, and in July amid revelations by the House’s Jan. 6 committee.&nbsp;</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">When it came to McCarthy, 43% of voters said they’d recently heard negative news, up from 25% the previous week and higher than any other time since Morning Consult began regularly tracking buzz early last year.&nbsp;</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Republican voters were about as likely to say they heard mostly positive news about the congressional GOP (36%) as they were to report hearing something negative about McCarthy (38%).&nbsp;</li></ul><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><i>The latest Morning Consult survey was conducted Jan. 5-8, 2023, among a representative sample of 1,977 registered voters, with an unweighted margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZLavv9Oapa1lmaPBpriOpJyvoZ5iuqSvwKurobFdqL2mrcqeqaygmaV6p63LpaaurA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1156144-bob-marley-children-html.html><span>←</span><span>How many children did Bob Marley have and where they are now?</span></a>
