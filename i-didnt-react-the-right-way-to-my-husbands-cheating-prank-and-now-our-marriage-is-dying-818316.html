If&nbsp;you think my&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I are very young and may let ourselves be&nbsp;very unserious, then it’s not&nbsp;so. I’m 36, and he’s 38, and&nbsp;I just can’t believe this is&nbsp;really happening. I&nbsp;even asked him to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;therapy with&nbsp;me, but he’s denying any type of&nbsp;conversation.»</p><p>Taylor went on&nbsp;with her story, sharing the shocking details of&nbsp;the conflict. She wrote, «A&nbsp;month ago, my&nbsp;beloved husband left his iPad on&nbsp;the counter when&nbsp;I was doing the dishes and went to&nbsp;the gym. Just later, after the whole drama happened, I&nbsp;understood why he&nbsp;actually was trying to&nbsp;draw my&nbsp;attention to&nbsp;the iPad the whole morning, placing it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the most visible place and leaving it&nbsp;near&nbsp;me. Now I&nbsp;know why.»</p><p>Taylor revealed, «While I&nbsp;was loading our dishwasher, he&nbsp;got a&nbsp;very suggestive text and a&nbsp;picture of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman in&nbsp;her underwear. The number belonged to&nbsp;some Ashley. I&nbsp;just froze in&nbsp;my&nbsp;tracks. We’ve been married for over 6&nbsp;years, and we&nbsp;have two <a href=# title=kids data-link=tag>kids</a> together. I&nbsp;started looking for more details and there was their full conversation for over 2&nbsp;weeks. He&nbsp;obviously was cheating on&nbsp;me&nbsp;with this Ashley.»</p><p><h2>Taylor was mad, but she didn’t deliver the reaction that her husband wanted.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a08/250/cbdb405ace9911cac13993d869.jpg><p>She described her initial reaction to&nbsp;the revelation, saying, «I&nbsp;can’t even describe the intensity of&nbsp;pain&nbsp;I felt at&nbsp;that moment. I&nbsp;immediately ran to&nbsp;the bathroom, I&nbsp;was vomiting and crying. Then he&nbsp;got back from the gym and instantly asked me&nbsp;what’s wrong. I&nbsp;just looked him in&nbsp;the eye, handed him his iPad and informed him that he’s got a&nbsp;message from Ashley and that&nbsp;I needed to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out for a&nbsp;walk. I&nbsp;asked him to&nbsp;stay with the children. He&nbsp;agreed.»</p><p>Then, Taylor went for a&nbsp;long 4-hour walk. She revealed that her husband texted her a&nbsp;thousand times asking if&nbsp;she was okay. Each time, she replied that she was fine, and said that she just needed some fresh air.</p><p>She shared, «I&nbsp;don’t remember a&nbsp;moment when&nbsp;I was crying this much through my&nbsp;entire life. When I&nbsp;got home, I&nbsp;told him that&nbsp;I was aware of&nbsp;his disgusting affair and asked him how we’re going to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this. He&nbsp;then asked&nbsp;me, „do&nbsp;what?“»</p><p>Taylor demonstrated a&nbsp;very calm reaction, she wrote, «I&nbsp;told him that we&nbsp;absolutely can’t stay married anymore. But what&nbsp;I needed to&nbsp;know was how we&nbsp;were going to&nbsp;separate with the least harm possible to&nbsp;the kids. I&nbsp;told him that since he&nbsp;has his parents living very close to&nbsp;us, he&nbsp;could move out and let me&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;our apartment with the kids for now until we&nbsp;get <a href=# title=divorced data-link=tag>divorced</a>.»</p><p><h2>Taylor’s husband instantly showed his true face.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1b3/1c8/6336dc52ee90aa21cabe3f1233.jpg><p>Taylor revealed that her conversation with her husband took a&nbsp;very weird turn. The woman wrote, «He&nbsp;asked me&nbsp;if&nbsp;that was really all my&nbsp;reaction and if&nbsp;I was kidding.<i> </i>I&nbsp;just stared at&nbsp;him, all puzzled. At&nbsp;that moment, I&nbsp;didn’t understand what he&nbsp;even wanted to&nbsp;say by&nbsp;all of&nbsp;this. I&nbsp;told him that&nbsp;I couldn’t speak more of&nbsp;this because&nbsp;I was just exhausted.»</p><p>And then, the epic reaction from the husband came out. Taylor wrote, «He&nbsp;suddenly started yelling that&nbsp;I was very careless and cold. My&nbsp;reaction to&nbsp;his infidelity wasn’t the one he&nbsp;expected. He&nbsp;then gave me&nbsp;the IPad, asked me&nbsp;to&nbsp;call „Ashley“. I&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;and ran to&nbsp;our room because&nbsp;I couldn’t believe how cruel he&nbsp;was making me&nbsp;call his mistress. But he&nbsp;insisted, and I&nbsp;called. The number belonged to&nbsp;his best friend, and he&nbsp;was laughing, saying it&nbsp;was all a&nbsp;funny prank.»</p><p>Taylor revealed, «It&nbsp;took me&nbsp;a&nbsp;few minutes to&nbsp;get&nbsp;it, but then&nbsp;I started sobbing. My&nbsp;husband was fuming at&nbsp;the way&nbsp;I handled his cheating prank. He&nbsp;was frustrated that&nbsp;I didn’t care enough. I&nbsp;have no&nbsp;clue what he&nbsp;wanted me&nbsp;to&nbsp;do. He&nbsp;even couldn’t explain what he&nbsp;expected me&nbsp;to&nbsp;do. He&nbsp;just yelled all the time that he&nbsp;didn’t expect this.»</p><p><h2>The family life was falling apart in&nbsp;an&nbsp;instant.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5b7/236/ba918154ceaea9690e982b472e.jpg><p>Taylor wrote, «Now a&nbsp;long time later he’s acting so&nbsp;cold and resistant with&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;even tried to&nbsp;apologize once and explained that&nbsp;I was feeling very hurt, but&nbsp;I was also shocked. I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;explain that&nbsp;I just didn’t want to&nbsp;bring damage to&nbsp;our children. I&nbsp;told him that&nbsp;I loved him so&nbsp;much and that if&nbsp;that was something real, it&nbsp;would have killed me&nbsp;mentally.»</p><p>«But he&nbsp;is&nbsp;very cold with&nbsp;me, and he&nbsp;doesn’t even listen. He&nbsp;said he&nbsp;wanted a&nbsp;divorce, because he&nbsp;can’t trust a&nbsp;woman who’s so&nbsp;cold and apathetic, and he&nbsp;is&nbsp;sure that my&nbsp;reaction was abnormal. And I&nbsp;think this whole incident is&nbsp;abnormal, but if&nbsp;he&nbsp;wants a&nbsp;divorce, then he’s getting&nbsp;it.»</p><p><h2>Advice from <strong>Bright Side</strong></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0a1/22f/b3f5e35ed0abcb31981d22a55d.jpg><p>Gett'em Girl, That was not a Prank that was just Cruel & done by someone that should go out of their way not to upset Or Hurt you & HE Got Mad, F-Him! That's not normal at all. Scary since you've children, don't trust him totally, as that was just Demented!</p><p>We’re very grateful to&nbsp;Taylor for sharing her story with&nbsp;us and her trust.</p><p>Here at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;believe that every person has a&nbsp;right for making a&nbsp;mistake. We&nbsp;feel for Taylor and can imagine what she was thinking and feeling at&nbsp;different moments of&nbsp;this family situation. But we&nbsp;think that the woman shouldn’t rush with the divorce, and probably the best thing in&nbsp;her situation would be&nbsp;just to&nbsp;let things settle a&nbsp;bit and then talk to&nbsp;her husband again.</p><p>The couple may even attend the therapy together, and they might work on&nbsp;their insecurities and problems together, too. And we&nbsp;strongly believe that Taylor’s marriage can still be&nbsp;saved by&nbsp;a&nbsp;proper professional help and patience from the both sides.</p><p>And here’s yet another story from a&nbsp;woman, whose husband deeply <a href=#>humiliated</a> her right on&nbsp;their wedding day. But you will be&nbsp;oddly satisfied to&nbsp;find out how this man met his instant karma.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZusMidpa1lopqupMCMrZ%2BeZaKetKnAjLCYsmWkpHquxYyhrKyakaOxtHnCoZyarJmjtG680ZqlpGWRo7Fuus6wZKitomK6or7RopignV2ewG6w2KKloGVoZoV0fZVo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./cillian-murphy-margot-robbie-barbenheimer-memes-box-office-success-1235820469.html><span>←</span><span>Cillian Murphy and Margot Robbie Discuss Barbenheimer Memes, Box Office Success</span></a>
