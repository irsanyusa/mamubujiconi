The message read, "The Fountain of Life Church Family, in total submission to the will of God Almighty, announces the passing unto greater glory of our Father, our Teacher, a great servant of the Most High God, Pastor Daniel Taiwo Odukoya, Founding Pastor of The Fountain of Life Church, who passed unto glory on the 7th of August 2023 in the USA."</p><p>The specific cause of his passing remains undisclosed, leaving many members of the church and the community in a state of deep grief and speculation. Pastor Taiwo Odukoya's influence and dedication to his congregation have left an indelible mark, making his loss all the more poignant.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>This tragic event comes less than two years after the demise of his 47-year-old South African wife, <strong>Nomthi Odukoya</strong>, on November 9, 2021. Born as <strong>Rosemary Simangele Zulu</strong>, her death occurred 11 years after her union with the Nigerian preacher. The late Nomthi Odukoya was a mother of two sons, <strong>Timilehin</strong> and <strong>Jomiloju</strong>, both of whom now face the tremendous loss of both their parents.</p><p>Pastor Taiwo Odukoya's life was marked by both personal triumphs and profound tragedies. His first wife, Pastor Bimbo, met her untimely end in the tragic Sosoliso plane crash of 2005, an incident that shook the nation and left an indelible scar on his heart.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXy1vsCgoJxllJqutbSMqZisrJ%2BnerWtyLCmZqeUqriwxcBmo56ZpprAbq%2FOp56rnZeWwaq7zWagp2WdpMKzusinnmiunWq5cYWQ</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-story-of-maria-montessori-an-ingenious-teacher-who-gave-up-her-own-son-to-continue-her-career-799952.html><span>←</span><span>The Story of Maria Montessori, an Ingenious Teacher Who Gave Up Her Own Son to Continue Her Career</span></a>
