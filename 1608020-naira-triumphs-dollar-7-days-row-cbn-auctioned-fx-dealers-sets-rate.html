high of N1,593 per dollar and a low of N1,500.</p><p class=align-left>However, the foreign exchange market experienced a decline in Forex turnover at $246.44 million.</p><p class=align-left>The

banks by the CBN last week via the Retail Dutch Auction System (rDAS).</p><p class=align-left>The apex bank embarked on the 1980s model auction to meet the growing demands for FX in the country, which analysts believe pressured the local <a href=#>currency</a>.</p><h2>CBN crashes dollar for authorised dealer banks</h2><p class=align-left>On Wednesday, August 7, 2024, CBN sold $876.26 million to authorised dealers via the Retail Dutch Auction System (rDAS) to reduce the pile of FX demands on the system.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img

billion foreign exchange demand by end users funded by 26 banks at N1,495 per dollar.</p><p class=align-left>The CBN stated this in a statement containing the summary of its Retail Dutch Auction signed by its director of the Financial Markets Department, Omolara Omotunde Duke.</p><h2>CBN sells dollar at N1,495 to banks</h2><p class=align-left>The statement disclosed that after the collation, the Committee of Governors of the CBN approved a cut-off bid of N1,495.00 per dollar with a total successful bid of $815,362,006.30.</p><p class=align-left>The sale represents 6.95% below the $876

Also, two banks needed to provide bids using a suitable template.</p><p class=align-left>Experts believe that the CBN's series of steps are responsible for the current value of the naira against the dollar.</p><p class=align-left>Janet Ogochukwu, a senior banker and financial analyst, predicted further gains for the naira against the dollar in the coming days.</p><p class=align-left>She said CBN will soon turn to other dealers, such as Bureau de Change (BDC) operators.</p>“When CBN begins to sell FX to the other players in the parallel segment of the FX market, we will see further improvements in the value of the naira.“Currently, CBN is fixated on clearing FX demands piled up in the banks via the rDAS.
