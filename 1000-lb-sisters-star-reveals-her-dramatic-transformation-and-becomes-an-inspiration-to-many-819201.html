Before the show, she and her sister Amy were popular YouTubers, known for their engaging content and a large number of followers.</p><p>Both sisters, in their thirties, had a combined weight of over 1,000 pounds. They faced challenges with weight loss and maintaining a <a href=# title=healthy data-link=tag>healthy</a> diet, but as of 2024, they’ve made significant progress. Let's take a look at Tammy's inspiring journey.</p><p><h2>Tammy’s path to&nbsp;a&nbsp;healthier lifestyle.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/581/6bd/e4a3115bc8b949ca6acc0da948.jpg><p>Initially, Tammy tipped the scales at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>717</a> pounds (325 kg). Due to her weight, she faced many difficulties in her daily life and also suffered from various health issues.</p><p>Tammy took up the challenge and decided to change things up. She spent 14 months at Windsor Lane Center in Gibsonburg. It was also where she met her husband. Sadly, he later passed away in <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2023</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c7c/ad7/c982cf5a4fa44870c5081bd939.png><p><h2>A&nbsp;challenge well accepted and executed.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7bc/80f/7fadca5423a8be0a2df472e96a.jpg><p>In late 2022, Tammy had a surgery. Now she weighs 285 pounds (129 kg), having shed over 400 pounds (181 kg).</p><p>Tammy is currently doing well as she recovers from her partner’s passing. She enjoys connecting with her fans from <i>1000-Lb Sisters</i> on <a href=# title=TikTok data-link=tag>TikTok</a>. There, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shares</a> lip-sync videos and moments with her new pet cat. A serious health scare was a pivotal moment for Tammy, leading her to take charge of her health. Her ongoing success continues to inspire her supporters and silence her critics.</p><p><h2>Overcoming adversity.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a9d/42b/cae89f5f3f91e6d4893d17f78a.jpg><p>You look great and should be very proud of yourself! Keep up the good work!!</p><p>Over the years, Tammy faced several health issues due to her increasing weight and <a href=# title=lifestyle data-link=tag>lifestyle</a> choices. In a critical event in November 2021, she was hospitalized and placed on life support. Despite also needing a tracheostomy, she made a remarkable recovery.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5c9/a5b/b539fd513ea700c205b063a8f3.jpg><p>You are doing a great job with your weight loss. Will you and Amy be coming back on TV TLC?</p><p><h2>An&nbsp;inspiration to&nbsp;many, she continues to&nbsp;shine.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6be/2ae/f2390f5c4293a53bf68eddb3db.jpg><p>Love the mermaid design.</p><p>In the last episode of the third season, which aired in January 2022, Tammy’s brother, Chris Combs, shared that she had lost 115 pounds (52 kg) while in a rehabilitation center in Ohio. Following her hospital stay, Tammy hinted at her weight loss in a TikTok video.</p><p>Back in January 2020, Tammy’s weight was around 600 pounds (272 kg). Although she managed to reduce her weight during the show, it fluctuated often. Recently, Tammy displayed her weight loss by spending time by the pool with her friend Haley Michelle. Haley posted a photo on Instagram showing Tammy in a navy-blue bathing suit, looking happy and relaxed by the poolside. Haley expressed her pride in Tammy’s achievement with a supportive hashtag.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ef5/75e/b4d25f59dd8b3f89d89fb4442d.jpg><p>Fans poured in comments on Tammy's photos, praising her. Many pointed out how she looks incredible, and her journey inspired them. Some also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>noted</a> how she did a more impressive job at getting healthier than her siblings.</p><p>However, some were also confused by the way Tammy posed with her friend. Many are wondering if the two are actually in a <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>relationship</a>.</p><p>Kelly Clarkson also recently debuted a slimmer figure that surprised fans.
