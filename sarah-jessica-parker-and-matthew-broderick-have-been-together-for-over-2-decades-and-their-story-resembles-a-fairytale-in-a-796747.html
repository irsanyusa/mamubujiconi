Parker’s older brother was running the Naked Angels Theater Company, and <strong>Broderick was a&nbsp;director in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;their plays</strong>. In&nbsp;1991, Sarah Jessica Parker broke up&nbsp;with Robert Downey&nbsp;Jr. after <a href=#>7&nbsp;years</a> of&nbsp;being together, and shortly after that, her brothers introduced her to&nbsp;Matthew.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7c5/c14/66cbdf57b194636ebec903f471.jpg><p>Parker <a href=#>shared</a> that, during that time, they were both young actors who just wanted to&nbsp;do&nbsp;their job well and who weren’t thinking about fame or&nbsp;money. In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;his interviews, Broderick <a href=#>revealed</a> that <strong>he&nbsp;still remembers the first time he&nbsp;saw Sarah, when she was walking into a&nbsp;movie theater</strong>. For him, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;very unique experience because, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;said, he&nbsp;rarely remembered people he&nbsp;saw walking down the street for the very first time.</p><p><h2>Matthew didn’t ask his future wife on&nbsp;a&nbsp;date for months.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e3c/562/90d73b54fca975f0db01eb1302.jpg><p>It&nbsp;took Broderick a&nbsp;pretty long time to&nbsp;finally ask Parker out. Matthew <a href=#>remembered</a> that months had literally passed before he&nbsp;made his first move. But<strong> on&nbsp;February&nbsp;1, he&nbsp;left a&nbsp;charming voice message</strong> and the couple started officially dating pretty soon after that.</p><p><h2>Their wedding was a&nbsp;surprise for their family and friends.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/910/9db/da7c34548288f0edbc5150825e.jpg><p>On&nbsp;May&nbsp;19, after 5&nbsp;years of&nbsp;being together, the couple decided to&nbsp;<a href=#>tie the knot</a> and threw a&nbsp;surprise wedding party. <strong>All 100 guests were sure that they were showing up&nbsp;to&nbsp;attend an&nbsp;ordinary party, but it&nbsp;turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;wedding</strong>. And that wasn’t the only surprise that day. Parker opted out of&nbsp;the traditional wedding dress and chose a&nbsp;black one instead.</p><p>She <a href=#>shared</a> that she had never really thought about her wedding dress. She <a href=#>said</a> that she chose it&nbsp;because she was a&nbsp;bold girl back then and <strong>was “too embarrassed” to&nbsp;spend time trying to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;wedding dress</strong>. So&nbsp;she just went to&nbsp;a&nbsp;store she liked and just took “whatever they had hanging.”</p><p><h2>Now they’re the proud parents of&nbsp;3&nbsp;children.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cfa/821/3fbcf15d259fff106469feefb7.jpg><p>Parker and Broderick have 3&nbsp;<a href=#>children</a>: their son James (2002) and twin daughters, Marion and Tabitha (2009). Parker <a href=#>shared</a> that the birth of&nbsp;their children was one of&nbsp;the most amazing moments in&nbsp;her life and that <strong>if&nbsp;she could revisit one moment from the past, that’d be&nbsp;the moment she’d like to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back&nbsp;to</strong>.</p><p><h2>Sarah and Matthew have been together for 22&nbsp;years, but they still know how to&nbsp;keep the spark alive.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5f0/9a8/c556b0593dbe41822850ac7e38.jpg><p>After 22&nbsp;years of&nbsp;marriage, the couple is&nbsp;still going strong. When journalists asked Parker about the secret to&nbsp;their happy relationship, she <a href=#>revealed</a> that they believe that <strong>time apart is&nbsp;just as&nbsp;important as&nbsp;time together</strong>. Because of&nbsp;their jobs, Sarah and Matthew have had to&nbsp;spend a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time away from each other, but they always manage to&nbsp;reunite and come back together.</p><p>Parker shares that people and their needs are going to&nbsp;change and<strong> </strong>that <strong>both partners should be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;accept these changes that will inevitably happen through the years</strong>.</p><p>Broderick <a href=#>shared</a> that the key to&nbsp;their happiness is&nbsp;that <strong>they’re friends beyond anything else</strong>. And his advice to&nbsp;all couples is&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep talking, because too much silence is&nbsp;definitely not a&nbsp;good idea.</p><p>Have you ever been in&nbsp;a&nbsp;long-term relationship?
