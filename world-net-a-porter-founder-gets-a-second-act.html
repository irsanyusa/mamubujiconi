The new firm plans to announce that it has raised $75 million for its first fund, money that the two expect to pour into direct-to-consumer startups like Glossier, which sells beauty product to millennials, and Keeps, a hair-loss prevention company.</p><p>“I didn’t have a specific plan other than to take a break,” Massenet said. “But while talking to various entrepreneurs, I found that this was something I enjoyed.”</p><p>The two are focused on investing in e-commerce startups as they have become bigger and attracted takeover interest from existing retailers. The clothier Bonobos sold itself to Walmart for $310 million in June, for example, while the latest investment in mattress-maker Casper valued it at $750 million.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Imaginary Ventures faces plenty of competition. Firms like Forerunner Ventures, Thrive Capital and Benchmark are active investors in e-commerce, on the hunt for the next Warby Parker (which recently raised $75 million) or Stitch Fix (which went public last year and is now valued at about $2 billion.)</p><p>Massenet and Brown are counting on Massenet’s Net-a-Porter experience and contacts to help Imaginary Ventures stand out. It has already invested in companies like Glossier and Everlane, a clothing brand.</p><p>“Their understanding of consumers in today’s age and how to build great brands and guide entrepreneurs is unparalleled,” Michael Preysman, Everlane’s founder, said in a statement.</p><p>Massenet began as a fashion journalist before founding Net-a-Porter in 2000. She left Net-a-Porter shortly after the e-commerce portal merged with rival Yoox in a deal with which she reportedly was unhappy.</p><p>Massenet had intended to largely retire, keeping a yellow Post-it note with the phrase “Just Say No” on her computer as a reminder of what to say to the flood of requests for business opportunities. Other than joining a Net-a-Porter rival, FarFetch, as co-chairwoman, she largely succeeded in doing just that.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Then came Brown. He was previously a partner at 14W Venture Partners, where he invested in the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop lifestyle site and the shoe brand Allbirds.</p><p>“We had been looking at the market from different perspectives,” Massenet said. “I realized there was no better person in the space to work with than Nick.”</p><p>Over the course of 2016, the two decided to join forces and began talking to prospective investors. Backers of the new firm include Rick Caruso, a real estate developer based in Los Angeles, and two fellow fashion entrepreneurs, Tom and Ruth Chapman, who built and then sold Matchesfashion.com.</p><p>MICHAEL J. de la MERCED © 2018 The New York Times</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkwamxjKecsGWppL%2BsedOipJ6rX6y8s7jDaK6oqpyZeq%2Bx02aYZqifp8Gmvoyfpq6mlJq%2FbrPErapmmV2osqS7zZ1kmpukZL%2BotsyncKA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./1533303-moneybagg-yos-kids-baby-mamas-how.html><span>←</span><span>Moneybagg Yos kids and baby mamas: how many does he have?</span></a>
